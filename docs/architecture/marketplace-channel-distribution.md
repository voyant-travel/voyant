# Marketplace Channel Distribution

Status: planning reference
Audience: anyone designing how local experience providers can use Voyant as their reservation system while selling through Viator, GetYourGuide, and similar marketplaces.

This document covers the outbound-channel direction:

```txt
Voyant owned inventory
  -> Viator / GetYourGuide as sales channels
  -> marketplace customers book
  -> marketplace calls Voyant for availability, price, reservation, booking, cancellation, and status
```

This is the inverse of [Marketplace Experiences Sourcing](./marketplace-experiences-sourcing.md), where Viator/GetYourGuide inventory is sourced into Voyant for resale.

## 1. Core Distinction

In this direction, Voyant is the **operator system of record**.

The local provider owns and operates the experience:

- product content originates in Voyant
- availability and capacity originate in Voyant
- pricing can originate in Voyant, subject to channel capability
- bookings land in Voyant
- holds, confirmations, cancellations, fulfillment, and redemption are managed in Voyant

Viator/GetYourGuide are **channels**, not inventory sources.

In Voyant vocabulary:

- **Owned Product**: the local provider runs the experience.
- **Channel**: a third-party sales surface that distributes the owned product.
- **Channel Product Mapping**: the relationship between a Voyant product/option and the marketplace's product/option identifier.
- **Channel Booking Link**: the relationship between a Voyant booking and the marketplace booking/reference.
- **Channel Adapter**: the integration package that exposes Voyant inventory and booking operations in the channel's required API shape.

## 2. Architectural Rule

Viator and GetYourGuide outbound integrations should be **distribution channel adapters**, not catalog source adapters.

They should sit on top of existing modules:

- `packages/inventory`
- `packages/operations`
- `packages/commerce`
- `packages/bookings`
- `packages/distribution`
- `packages/bookings/src/requirements`
- `packages/fulfillment` concepts inside bookings

The core modules should stay provider-agnostic. Channel-specific payloads, status codes, certification quirks, auth requirements, retries, and mapping rules belong in adapter packages.

Suggested packages:

- `@voyant-travel/channel-viator-supplier`
- `@voyant-travel/channel-getyourguide-supplier`

These packages may be distributed as plugins later, but their runtime role is adapter/extension, not a new domain module.

## 3. Current State

Voyant already has useful foundations:

- Products, options, units, media, locations, and content live in `packages/products`.
- Availability rules, start times, generated slots, pickup points, cutoff, and capacity live in `packages/availability`.
- Bookings support hold, confirm, expire, cancel, allocation, fulfillment, redemption, and audit activity.
- `packages/distribution` has channels, contracts, commission rules, product mappings, booking links, webhook events, allotments, release rules, settlement, and reconciliation structures.
- No production external channel facade is currently mounted. OCTO support is
  deferred until a deployment requires a certified adapter over these modules.

The missing part is a production-grade marketplace channel facade:

- Viator Supplier API-compatible endpoints.
- GetYourGuide reservation-system-compatible endpoints.
- channel-specific mapping and capability setup.
- certification-grade error handling, idempotency, auth, and test harnesses.
- operational jobs for availability notification, reconciliation, and sync health.

## 4. Directional Model

The target shape is:

```txt
Voyant product / option / unit
  -> channel product mapping
  -> channel reads product/availability/price
  -> customer books on channel
  -> channel reserves or books through Voyant adapter
  -> Voyant creates local booking + allocation
  -> Voyant returns confirmation/Service Voucher/reference
  -> channel displays marketplace Service Voucher/customer confirmation
  -> post-book changes reconcile through channel booking links
```

Voyant remains the operational source of truth. The marketplace receives enough data to sell and service the booking, but does not own the operator's inventory.

## 5. Product And Option Mapping

Marketplace channels generally need explicit mapping.

Required mapping concepts:

```txt
channel_product_mappings
  channel_id
  product_id
  option_id
  external_product_id
  external_option_id
  external_rate_id
  external_category_id
  status
  capabilities
  last_validated_at
  validation_errors
```

The existing `channelProductMappings` table already covers the first part of this shape: channel, product, external product/rate/category, and active state. It likely needs option-level precision and richer validation/capability metadata for marketplace certification.

Mapping must support:

- one Voyant product to one channel product
- one Voyant product with multiple options to multiple channel options
- channel-specific ticket categories mapped to Voyant option units or pricing categories
- start-time/language/pickup variants when the channel treats them as separate options
- active/inactive mapping state
- validation feedback from the channel

## 6. Channel Connectivity Modes

### 6.1 Viator Supplier / Reservation System API

Viator's supplier-side integration expects the reservation system to expose APIs that Viator calls.

Typical capabilities:

- tour/product list for mapping
- product validation/details
- calendar availability and pricing
- real-time availability check
- reserve/hold
- booking creation
- amendment
- cancellation
- redemption verification
- availability notification where supported

Newer Viator supplier APIs include v2 availability/check, calendar, reserve, and booking concepts. Older v1 endpoints exist but should be treated as legacy unless a certification path requires compatibility.

### 6.2 GetYourGuide Reservation-System Connectivity

GetYourGuide connectivity can involve inbound or outbound connector modes.

From Voyant's perspective, the relevant target is: GetYourGuide can read availability and prices and send reservations/bookings to the supplier reservation system.

Typical capabilities:

- product list
- product details
- option mapping
- pricing categories
- availability by ticket category
- price over API
- reservation expiration
- booking/reservation processing
- notify availability update
- deals/promotions where enabled
- reactivation and product validation workflows

Some capabilities are gated by GetYourGuide partner status, feature activation, or integrator portal approval.

## 7. Channel Adapter Surface

Voyant should define a shared outbound channel adapter contract before building provider-specific packages.

Possible contract:

```ts
interface MarketplaceChannelAdapter {
  readonly kind: "viator-supplier" | "getyourguide-supplier" | string
  readonly capabilities: MarketplaceChannelCapabilities

  listProducts(ctx, query): Promise<ChannelProductList>
  getProduct(ctx, mapping): Promise<ChannelProductDetail>
  getAvailability(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelAvailabilityResponse>
  getPrice(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelPriceResponse>
  reserve(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelReservationResponse>
  confirmBooking(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelBookingResponse>
  amendBooking?(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelAmendmentResponse>
  cancelBooking(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelCancellationResponse>
  getBookingStatus(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelBookingStatusResponse>
  redeem?(ctx, request): Promise<ChannelRedemptionResponse>
}
```

Provider packages then translate between:

- channel-specific request/response schemas
- Voyant internal services
- channel booking/mapping records
- channel-specific error codes

## 8. API Boundary

Channel APIs should not be mounted under customer-facing `/v1/public/*`.

They are machine-to-machine channel endpoints.

Possible route shape:

```txt
/v1/channels/viator-supplier/*
/v1/channels/getyourguide-supplier/*
```

or, when mounted per channel connection:

```txt
/v1/channel-connections/:connectionId/viator/*
/v1/channel-connections/:connectionId/getyourguide/*
```

Requirements:

- authentication per channel connection
- request signing or API key validation where required
- channel-specific content type support
- idempotency keys for reserve/book/cancel operations
- request/response audit logging
- deterministic error mapping
- correlation ids
- rate limiting and abuse protection

## 9. Availability And Pricing

Marketplace channels need two categories of availability/pricing data.

### 9.1 Calendar / Batch Availability

Used for marketplace browse calendars and date availability.

Voyant source:

- availability rules
- generated slots
- remaining capacity
- cutoff state
- pickup/resource constraints where needed
- public price catalogs or channel-specific price catalogs

Output:

- available/unavailable dates
- capacity or vacancy where supported
- from price
- per-ticket-category price where supported
- cutoff information
- unavailable reason where supported

### 9.2 Real-Time Availability / Price Check

Used during the booking funnel.

Voyant source:

- locked or live slot state
- requested traveler/category mix
- requested option/start time/date
- pricing catalog/rules
- sellability constraints
- pickup/meeting requirements

Output:

- available/unavailable
- exact price
- available capacity
- booking cutoff
- reservation/hold eligibility
- channel-specific unavailable reason

Real-time checks must not create local bookings unless the channel specifically calls a reserve/hold endpoint.

## 10. Reservation And Booking

Channels may separate reservation/hold from booking confirmation.

Voyant should preserve that distinction:

```txt
channel reserve
  -> Voyant reserveBooking
  -> local booking status: on_hold
  -> local allocations: held
  -> channel booking link created

channel confirm/book
  -> Voyant confirmBooking
  -> local booking status: confirmed
  -> allocations confirmed
  -> fulfillment artifacts issued where applicable
  -> channel booking link updated
```

If a channel sends only a confirmed booking without a prior reserve, the adapter can perform reserve + confirm in one transaction-like flow.

Hard requirements:

- idempotency by channel booking/reference key
- no double allocation on retries
- deterministic response if the same request is replayed
- hold expiry alignment with channel rules
- release held capacity when channel reservation expires or is abandoned
- clear mapping of channel status to Voyant status

## 11. Booking Requirements

Voyant must expose the fields a channel needs to complete a booking.

Potential sources:

- `packages/bookings/src/requirements`
- product settings
- product option/unit constraints
- pickup/meeting configuration
- ticket/fulfillment requirements
- legal/waiver requirements

Needed outputs:

- traveler names required
- traveler ages/date of birth required
- lead traveler/contact required
- hotel pickup field required
- language selection required
- Service Voucher delivery constraints
- accessibility/dietary/free-text fields

The adapter should normalize these into the channel-specific contract and validate incoming booking payloads against the active requirements.

## 12. Fulfillment, Vouchers, And Redemption

For channel bookings, Voyant may need to return:

- supplier confirmation number
- booking reference
- barcode or QR code
- Service Voucher URL
- ticket URL
- per-traveler ticket artifacts
- meeting/pickup instructions
- emergency contact
- redemption validation result

Voyant should store channel-delivered references in `channelBookingLinks` and store actual fulfillment artifacts in booking fulfillment records.

If the channel owns the customer Service Voucher, Voyant still needs a supplier-side confirmation reference and operational check-in view.

## 13. Post-Book Operations

Adapters should support, by capability:

- cancellation
- amendment
- reservation expiration
- booking status lookup
- Service Voucher reissue
- redemption verification
- no-show or check-in status where applicable

Post-book operations must update:

- local booking status
- allocation status/capacity
- channel booking link
- booking activity log
- reconciliation state
- refund/finance state where applicable

## 14. Reconciliation And Settlement

Marketplace bookings need reconciliation because channel-side truth and local truth can drift.

Reconciliation should compare:

- booking existence
- booking status
- cancellation status
- booked date/time/option
- traveler/category counts
- gross amount
- commission/net amount
- payout/remittance amount
- Service Voucher/reference state

The existing distribution reconciliation and settlement tables are the right home for this, but provider-specific processors are needed.

Settlement concerns:

- commission rate
- net-rate resale
- channel-collected payment
- operator-collected payment
- refund liability
- chargeback liability
- payout timing
- tax/fee treatment

## 15. Admin Experience

Operators should be able to:

- create Viator/GetYourGuide channels
- configure API credentials and endpoint exposure
- set contract/payment/cancellation ownership
- map products/options/categories
- validate mappings
- choose whether availability/pricing is exposed
- configure channel price catalog/markups where supported
- define allotments or channel caps
- inspect sync health and channel API logs
- inspect incoming reservations/bookings
- reconcile booking/status/payment mismatches
- pause or disable a channel without deleting history

Admin language should be explicit:

- "Sell this owned product on Viator"
- "Map this Voyant option to a GetYourGuide option"
- "Channel booking"
- "Channel reference"

Avoid language such as "import from Viator" in this direction.

## 16. Storefront Impact

This direction does not require Voyant's storefront to change.

The marketplace is the storefront for channel bookings. Voyant may still run its own storefront in parallel, but channel distribution should operate through distribution and channel APIs, not storefront routes.

Shared inventory must remain consistent across:

- direct storefront bookings
- admin/manual bookings
- Viator bookings
- GetYourGuide bookings
- other channel bookings

The allocation layer is the point of consistency.

## 17. Required Platform Changes

To make this production-ready, Voyant needs:

1. Shared outbound marketplace channel adapter contract.
2. Viator Supplier API adapter package.
3. GetYourGuide reservation-system adapter package.
4. Channel connection credentials and auth middleware.
5. Product/option/category mapping enhancements.
6. Channel-specific product/detail serializers.
7. Availability/calendar/check serializers.
8. Channel-specific reserve/book/cancel/amend handlers.
9. Idempotency store keyed by channel request identifiers.
10. Booking requirement export and inbound payload validation.
11. Fulfillment/Service Voucher/barcode mapping.
12. Channel booking reconciliation processors.
13. Availability/pricing notification jobs where supported.
14. Certification test harnesses for each channel.
15. Operational logging and support diagnostics.

## 18. Implementation Slices

### Slice 1: Channel Foundation

Goal: represent Viator/GetYourGuide as channels and map products.

Deliver:

- channel setup guidance
- mapping UI extensions
- option-level mapping
- credential/config storage

- availability calendar endpoint shape
- real-time availability/price endpoint shape
- channel-specific error mapping
- certification fixtures for read flows

### Slice 3: Reservation And Booking

Goal: channel can reserve and confirm owned inventory in Voyant.

Deliver:

- reserve endpoint
- booking endpoint
- idempotency
- channel booking link creation
- hold expiry/release behavior
- booking activity log integration

### Slice 4: Post-Book Operations

Goal: channel-originated bookings can be managed after confirmation.

Deliver:

- cancellation
- amendment where supported
- booking status lookup
- Service Voucher/reference response
- redemption verification where supported

### Slice 5: Reconciliation And Operations

Goal: operator can support channel bookings at scale.

Deliver:

- reconciliation runs
- settlement matching
- health dashboard
- failed request replay
- mapping validation reports
- certification checklist

## 19. Open Questions

- Should the outbound adapter contract live in `packages/distribution` or a new `packages/channel-adapters` package?
- Should Viator and GetYourGuide be mounted as public internet endpoints by default, or only through explicit template configuration?
- Do we support direct API connectivity first, or OCTO first where channels can consume it?
- Which product fields must be source-of-truth in Voyant versus still configured in the marketplace supplier portal?
- Do we model channel-specific ticket categories as pricing categories, option units, or a mapping layer over both?
- How much pricing control should channels have versus Voyant price catalogs?
- What is the minimum cancellation/amendment support required for first certification?
- How do channel-specific booking questions map back into Voyant's booking requirements?
- Should availability notifications be push jobs from Voyant or pulled by channels only?
- What support tools are needed before operators can rely on this in production?

## 20. Non-Goals

For this direction, do not build:

- sourced inventory ingestion from Viator/GetYourGuide
- a new experiences vertical separate from `products`
- channel-specific forks of product, availability, or booking core logic
- marketplace-specific booking tables that bypass local bookings
- storefront-specific routes for machine-to-machine marketplace connectivity
- fake local bookings that do not allocate capacity

## 21. Design Bar

This direction is correct when:

- Voyant remains the operator's inventory source of truth.
- Viator/GetYourGuide can sell mapped products without manual rekeying.
- Marketplace bookings create real Voyant bookings and allocations.
- Retries do not double-book inventory.
- Channel references are preserved for support and reconciliation.
- Operators can pause, validate, and troubleshoot each channel.
- Adding another marketplace later does not require rewriting products, availability, bookings, or distribution core.
