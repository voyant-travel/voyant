# ADR: D.2 — package-owned migrations + topological collector

- **Status:** **Done.** The dual-path collector (`applyD2Migrations` — renamed `applyMigrations` in `framework-migrations@0.6.0`, which also dropped the legacy execute-only `applyMigrations`/`importBaseline`), per-package migration folders, the cutline manifest, the portable deployment runner (`discoverMigrationSources` + `runDeploymentMigrations`, `framework-migrations@0.5.x`), and the live operator runner all shipped. **Both existing deployments (eturia + protravel) cut over to D.2 on 2026-06-20** (ledger-only import-baseline, validated on isolated Neon branches first). The cutline is now **frozen** and the bundle is decommissioned from the apply path + the staleness gate (slice 3c, below).
- **Date:** 2026-06-20
- **Shipped:**
  - `applyD2Migrations` dual-path collector + cutline (`@voyant-travel/framework-migrations`) — PR #2014 (3b-1).
  - Per-package migration folders for all 24 schema-owning sources, the `cutline.generated.json` manifest, and the `verify-package-baseline.mjs --union` gate with **reverse-coverage** (every bundle table must be owned by some source — caught `flights` + `catalog-authoring` as un-onboarded owners) — PR #2016.
  - The live operator runner (`starters/operator/scripts/migrate.ts`) rewritten to discover package sources from `drizzle.schemas.generated.ts`, topo-order by `requiresSchemas`, and apply via the dual-path collector; the framework bundle is no longer loaded on the apply path — PR #2018 (3b-2).
- **Validated by:** `spikes/d2-migration-collector/run.mjs` (18/18 on the docker test DB) — proves the fresh-vs-existing dual path, import-baseline (no re-create, verified by stable table OIDs), topo-ordering + cycle rejection, the negative control (naive execute → `duplicate_table`), and **column-level convergence** of a fresh D.2 DB and a transitioned D.1 DB. The spike also surfaced the **baseline cutline** requirement (Decision 5).
- **Supersedes (on acceptance):** the single combined history of `migration-resilience-rfc.md` (voyant#1608) and the standard-profile-only scope of `migration-collector-d1.md`. D.1 explicitly deferred this: *"D.2 (package-owned migrations) would supersede #1608; it is out of scope here and gated behind its own ADR."*
- **Implements:** `consolidated-deployments-rfc.md` Workstream **D.2**.
- **Builds on:** `migration-collector-d1.md` (the multi-source collector primitive). D.2 reuses the collector and ledger **unchanged** — `planMigrations` / `applyMigrations` / `importBaseline` in `packages/framework-migrations/src/collector.ts` are untouched. Only *how sources are produced, ordered, and reconciled with existing ledgers* changes.

## Context

D.1 moved migration-history **ownership** from the deployment fork to the framework, while keeping a **single aggregate-generated history**. It ships one monolithic `framework` bundle (`@voyant-travel/framework-migrations`, priority 0) plus the deployment's own source (link tables + custom modules, priority 1). The collector applies sources in `(priority → in-source seq)` order against a version-independent `_voyant_migrations(source, tag, content_hash)` ledger whose primary key is **`(source, tag)`**.

D.1 is clean **only for the standard profile** — a deployment mounting exactly the reference module set. The moment a deployment **adds or removes a module**, it diverges from the fixed aggregate bundle: the bundle either creates tables the deployment doesn't want, or omits tables it does. D.1's own scope boundary names the fix as D.2 — *package-owned migrations + a topological collector*.

The collector primitive is already source-agnostic: `planMigrations()` sorts N sources by `(priority, seq)`. The hard part of D.2 is therefore **not** the apply engine — it is (a) **producing** per-package sources, (b) **ordering** them correctly, and (c) **reconciling the D.1 → D.2 transition** so that a single design works for *both* existing monolithic-ledger databases *and* fresh arbitrary-subset databases. Getting (c) wrong is how this turns into duplicate-DDL failures on live databases.

## Decision (proposed)

### 1. Each schema-owning package ships its own complete `migrations/` history

One drizzle migrations folder per package — generated from that package's own schema, shipped exactly as `@voyant-travel/framework-migrations` ships its bundle today, but per-package. **The folder contains the package's full history (its baseline + every increment)**, not just new migrations — fresh arbitrary-subset databases must be able to create historical package tables *without* the old monolithic bundle, which is the whole point of supporting module removal. Each package exports a loader (mirroring `loadFrameworkBundleSource()` / `loadMigrationFolder()`).

### 2. Discovery resolves the schema **closure**, not the mounted set

A deployment's sources are not just the packages in `voyant.config.ts`. The aggregate schema list already pulls in transitive, non-mounted schema dependencies — e.g. `@voyant-travel/db` appears in `starters/operator/drizzle.schemas.generated.ts` though it is in no `modules`/`extensions`/`additionalSchemas` entry. D.2 **reuses the same closure resolver that emits `drizzle.schemas.generated.ts`** — the one driven by each package's `voyant.requiresSchemas` metadata (`packages/catalog/package.json` declares `requiresSchemas: ["@voyant-travel/db"]`; the closure is already walked in `scripts/check-retail-spine-closure.mjs`). The set of migration sources is exactly the set of packages in that resolved schema closure, plus the deployment-local source.

### 3. Topological ordering from `voyant.requiresSchemas` (DAG now, not deferred)

This is a **topological** collector, not merely an ordered one. Order package sources by a topological sort of the `voyant.requiresSchemas` DAG — the same metadata the closure resolver already consumes, which already throws on cycles. The `voyant.config.ts` module-array order is used only as a **deterministic tie-breaker** among packages with no dependency edge between them. The deployment-local source (cross-module link tables + `src/modules`/`src/extensions`) is pinned **last** — its link tables FK into every module.

(Restating D.1's invariant: ordering is **per-run**, not a global guarantee. A new package migration on a later upgrade may apply *after* deployment migrations that ran in an earlier run — safe because DDL is forward-only and the ledger records only what is applied.)

### 4. Per-package source identity comes from package metadata, never paths or versions

A source's `name` (the ledger key half) must be **stable across refactors and versions**. Derive it from the package name plus its declared `voyant.schema` entrypoint — *not* the filesystem path and *not* the package version. Schema subpaths vary by package (`@voyant-travel/storefront` → `./verification/schema`; `@voyant-travel/flights` → `./reference/local-postgres`), so the folder location is discovered via metadata, but the **ledger source name is the package identity** and is frozen once shipped. `introducedInVersion` (if ever needed) stays metadata-only, exactly as in D.1.

### 5. The D.1 → D.2 transition is **append-only** — execute on fresh, import-baseline on existing

This is the load-bearing decision; the rest is mechanics. **The monolithic `framework` bundle is decommissioned from the apply path** — it is *not* a D.2 source. The same migrate run must do the right thing for two starting states, distinguished by the **presence of `framework/*` rows in the ledger** (validated as the detection key in the spike):

- **Fresh D.2 database (no `framework/*` rows):** execute each package's baseline + increments normally (`applyMigrations`), recording `<source>/<tag>` per package. The old bundle never runs — fresh databases get their schema entirely from package sources (proven schema-equivalent to the bundle in the spike).
- **Existing D.1 database (has `framework/*` rows):** the historical schema is already materialised under the monolithic `framework` source. Run the **parity guard first** (the D.1 `assertSchemaAtBaseline` pattern — every expected table/column present, every dropped table gone), then **`importBaseline()` the bundle-covered per-package baseline rows *without executing their SQL*** (`importBaseline` already records rows `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`). The old `framework/*` rows are **kept as audit history and never rewritten**; package increments that postdate the bundle apply normally on top.

**The baseline cutline (surfaced by the spike).** "Bundle-covered" is not inferable — each package must **declare which of its migrations the retired bundle already materialised** (the spike models this as a per-package `baselineTags` set; production likely ships it as a manifest the bundle generator emits, naming the package/tag pairs the last monolithic bundle contained). On an existing D.1 database the collector import-baselines exactly those tags and **executes everything after the cutline**; on a fresh database the cutline is irrelevant. Without this declaration the collector cannot distinguish "already created by the bundle" from "genuinely new" and would either re-create (collision) or skip new DDL. This is a hard input to Required Slice 1.

Why this resolves the conflict the naïve umbrella model could not (each point validated by a spike scenario):

- Packages **do** ship historical baselines (Decision 1) → fresh subset databases can build historical tables. ✔ (spike S1/S6)
- Existing D.1 databases **import-baseline** those baselines instead of executing them → **no duplicate DDL**; verified by stable table OIDs (nothing re-created). ✔ (spike S2)
- Naively executing a bundle-covered baseline on an existing DB raises `duplicate_table` → import-baseline is *required*, not optional. ✔ (spike S3, negative control)
- No applied ledger row is ever re-keyed → the immutability law is never tripped. ✔

**Corollary — no incremental single-package pilot.** Because the frozen bundle creates every standard table with bare `CREATE TABLE` and `0000` is immutable, a package cannot be moved to its own source *while the bundle still owns it* (a fresh DB would double-create; carving it out of `0000` would emit a `DROP`). D.2 is therefore an **all-standard-packages-at-once** flip that decommissions the bundle in the same change. The spike — not a production single-package rollout — is the de-risking vehicle.

### Why a blind re-key is wrong (correcting the immutability claim)

It is tempting to say "the content-hash immutability guard prevents re-keying." **That is not what the guard does.** `MigrationImmutabilityError` fires only when the *same* `(source, tag)` reappears with a *different* `content_hash`. Because the ledger primary key is `(source, tag)`, renaming a source (`framework/0003_x` → `catalog/0003_x`) produces a **new key the collector has never seen**, so the migration looks **unapplied** and `applyMigrations` **re-executes its SQL** — duplicate `CREATE TABLE`/`CREATE INDEX`/`CREATE TYPE` against tables that already exist. The failure mode is duplicate-DDL, not an immutability error. This is precisely why Decision 5 *import-baselines* (records without executing) rather than re-keying.

### 6. Module removal: fresh-subset is in scope; live uninstall is its own capability

- **Fresh subset selection (in scope):** a deployment that never mounted module X simply has no X source in its closure. Nothing to drop. ✔
- **Live uninstall of an already-applied module (out of scope for v1, specified here so it isn't assumed):** dropping a module from a live database requires teardown DDL, and that DDL is **deployment-owned, not package-owned** — a package cannot know which deployments installed it, and removing FK-bearing tables can break the deployment's own link migrations. If/when live uninstall is taken on, it needs: (a) deployment-authored drop migrations in the deployment-local source (which already sorts last), (b) prior teardown of cross-module link rows/tables that FK into the departing package, and (c) a guard that refuses to drop a package whose tables are still referenced. v1 explicitly supports **additive** evolution + **fresh subset** only.

### 7. Oracle: aggregate replay across N sources, and CI must fail closed

`verify-migration-replay-parity.mjs` becomes the cross-source drift detector for N package sources. It must (not "should"):

1. **Enumerate** the resolved package sources + the deployment source and log the list (silent under-enumeration is itself a failure).
2. **Seed required extensions** (`pg_trgm`, `unaccent`) on the push DB.
3. Apply all sources onto a fresh DB and `drizzle-kit push` the aggregate schema onto another.
4. Assert **non-empty, plausible counts on both sides** (tables/columns/indexes/constraints within an expected floor) *before* trusting equality, then assert **fingerprint equality**.
5. **Fail the CI job if the DB-backed oracle cannot run at all** (no skip-as-pass). The oracle is the only thing that catches per-source drift; a green build with a skipped oracle is a false negative.

The "fail closed" requirement is a direct lesson from the 2026-06-20 postmortem below: a silently-skipped or empty-DB oracle reads identical to "everything passed."

## Required implementation slices — SHIPPED

These kept package-owned history *trustworthy* and were part of acceptance:

1. **Per-package generation + staleness gate + baseline cutline.** ✅ Each schema-owning package has a `drizzle.migrations.config.ts` + a `db:generate` (chaining `guard-create-type` + `ensure-extensions`) emitting into its `migrations/`. The cutline manifest lives in `@voyant-travel/framework-migrations/cutline.generated.json`, generated from the package folders by `scripts/d2/generate-cutline.mjs` with a semantic drift gate (`verify:d2-cutline`).
2. **Per-package replay/parity.** ✅ `scripts/d2/verify-package-baseline.mjs` proves each package's `migrations/` reconstitutes its own tables column-for-column vs the bundle (closure-aware), and `--union` proves all sources apply together *and* every bundle table is owned by some source (**reverse-coverage**).
3. **Publishing contract.** ✅ Each onboarded package's `files` includes `migrations/*.sql` + `migrations/meta/_journal.json`; the loader contract is `loadMigrationFolder` from `@voyant-travel/framework-migrations`.

## Decommission (slice 3c) — only two D.1 deployments

There is **no long tail of D.1 databases in the wild**: exactly two deployments ran the D.1 collector, and both are source-controlled by us. So the bundle + cutline + dual-path are a **short-lived transition artifact**, not permanent infrastructure — we deliberately do **not** build a freeze-forever oracle or reframe the equivalence gates around an evolving cutline.

**What happened (done 2026-06-20):**
1. ✅ Both deployments cut over: the EXISTING path import-baselined the cutline (eturia 26 / protravel 66 baselines, 0 executed), validated first on isolated Neon branches. Their ledgers now carry `<package>/<tag>` rows; `framework/*` (eturia) and legacy `__drizzle_migrations` (protravel) are inert history.
2. ✅ **The cutline is FROZEN, not deleted.** Correcting the original plan: the cutline and the EXISTING/import-baseline path are **not** removable. A transitioned deployment stays permanently "existing" (its `framework/*` / legacy rows persist), so every future run takes the EXISTING path; and a NEW package migration must fall OUTSIDE the frozen cutline so the collector EXECUTES it (adding it to the cutline would make those deployments skip its DDL forever). `scripts/d2/generate-cutline.mjs` no longer regenerates-and-compares — it asserts the frozen cutline's tags still exist and lets post-cutline increments through.
3. ✅ **Bundle decommissioned from the gates** (kept frozen on disk as the completeness oracle + transition-test seed, not deleted): the `verify:framework-migration-bundle` staleness gate is removed from `verify:architecture` (it regenerated the bundle and would force it to grow as packages evolve), and `verify-package-baseline.mjs` now scopes its bundle comparison to **cutline-covered** migrations (a post-cutline increment correctly diverges from the frozen bundle) while still applying *all* sources for the collision check.

**Package evolution now works:** adding a new package migration is a post-cutline increment — it executes on every database (fresh and transitioned), is excluded from the bundle comparison, and is never absorbed into the cutline.

## Open questions (genuine unknowns to resolve before/with implementation)

1. **Tie-breaker stability.** Config-array order is the tie-breaker among independent packages (Decision 3). Confirm it is stable enough, or whether a lexical sort on source name is preferable for reproducibility.
2. **Cutline manifest source of truth.** The baseline cutline (Decision 5) must be generated from the *actual* final monolithic bundle and frozen — settle where it lives (a file in `@voyant-travel/framework-migrations`? per-package metadata?) and how CI proves it matches what the bundle shipped, so it can never silently drift.
3. **Parity-guard granularity for partial baselines.** D.1's guard checks the whole net schema; per-package import-baseline may want a per-package parity assertion so a partially-converged DB is rejected per-source rather than wholesale.
4. **Live uninstall demand (Decision 6).** Is additive + fresh-subset sufficient for foreseeable deployments, or is live module removal a near-term requirement that should be scoped now rather than deferred?

*(Resolved by the spike: the dual-path detection key, import-baseline-without-execute, topo-ordering, and the need for a baseline cutline. ADR-original Open Question 2 — a single-package production pilot — is retired by the no-incremental-pilot corollary in Decision 5.)*

## Postmortem note (why this ADR is being written now)

Validating the D.1 single-folder collapse (2026-06-20) surfaced that the replay-parity oracle had been silently comparing against an **empty** push database: `drizzle.config.ts` loaded `.dev.vars` with `override: true`, clobbering the `DATABASE_URL` the oracle injected, so `drizzle-kit push` ran against a non-extension DB, aborted on a `gin_trgm_ops` index, and **exited 0**. Fixed by making an explicit `DATABASE_URL` win (`fix(operator): explicit DATABASE_URL must win over .dev.vars`). The lesson is encoded in Decision 7: the oracle must fail closed and assert real counts, because per-source drift detection is the only safety net D.2 has.

## Graph deployments: custom module migrations (voyant#3069)

A **source-free managed image** (`voyant-operator-runtime:<framework-version>`,
platform#953/#954) runs migrations with **no drizzle-kit generation** and no
generated schema-path list — so `discoverMigrationSources` (which maps schema
paths → package roots) doesn't apply. The managed booter instead knows only the
module package **names** the profile snapshot declares.

Two source kinds:

- **Standard-profile modules** — already baked into the shipped **framework
  bundle** (`loadFrameworkBundleSource`, priority 0). No per-module work.
- **Custom (bring-your-own) schema-owning modules** — declared under the
  snapshot's `customSource.modules`. Each such package **ships its own committed
  drizzle `migrations/` folder** (Option 1: pre-built, predictable — no
  per-build generation), exactly as standard packages already do (`bookings`,
  `finance`, … each ship `migrations/meta/_journal.json`).

Resolution + ordering:

- `loadModuleBundleSource(packageName, { priority, resolveFrom })`
  (`@voyant-travel/framework-migrations`) resolves the package's root by name and
  loads its `migrations/` as a `MigrationSource`, or `null` when it ships none (a
  schema-less module/plugin — skipped). The ledger source name is the unscoped
  package name, stable across source and managed modes.
- `collectDeploymentMigrationSources({ modulePackages, resolveFrom })` returns
  `[framework(0), ...customModules(1..n)]` deps-first — hand straight to
  `runDeploymentMigrations`.
- `getVoyantProjectMigrationMetadata(project)` now returns
  `moduleSources: { packageName, priority }[]` derived from
  `customSource.modules`, so the platform booter enumerates the packages to load
  without a build artifact.

Plugins that own no schema (e.g. `@voyant-travel/plugin-netopia`) are unaffected —
they define no `pgTable` and ship no `migrations/`, so they resolve to `null` and
need no migration step. Unblocks Slice 4 of platform#1016.
