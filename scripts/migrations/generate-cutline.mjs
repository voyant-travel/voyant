/**
 * D.2 — the BASELINE CUTLINE manifest (FROZEN at cutover).
 * ADR: docs/architecture/migration-collector-d2.md (Decision 5 + Decommission).
 *
 * The cutline records, per package source, which migration tags were already
 * materialised when the existing deployments were transitioned off the retired
 * framework bundle / legacy runner. On an EXISTING database the D.2 collector
 * IMPORT-BASELINES exactly these tags (records them applied without executing —
 * the tables already exist) and EXECUTES everything AFTER the cutline.
 *
 * It is **frozen**. Once the deployments cut over (done 2026-06-20: eturia +
 * protravel), the cutline must NEVER absorb new tags — a NEW package migration
 * must fall OUTSIDE the cutline so it EXECUTES on those databases (adding it to
 * the cutline would make them skip its DDL forever). So this no longer
 * regenerates-and-compares; it only asserts the frozen cutline's tags still
 * exist (cutline migrations are immutable history) and that new tags are simply
 * post-cutline increments.
 *
 *   default     : check — fail if a frozen cutline tag was deleted/renamed. (CI gate.)
 *   --emit-init : (RE)WRITE the cutline from ALL current package tags. ONLY for the
 *                 one-time initial cutover — re-running it AFTER cutover absorbs
 *                 post-cutline migrations and breaks transitioned deployments.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/migrations/generate-cutline.mjs [--emit-init]
