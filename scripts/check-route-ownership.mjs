/**
 * Enforces route ownership from docs/architecture/api-route-ownership-and-composition.md (Phase 0).
 *
 * Reusable framework route interfaces belong in packages, composed through
 * `ApiModule` / `ApiExtension` registries — not hand-authored under
 * `starters/*​/src/api`. This checker is the guard that stops the second route
 * door (direct `/v1/...` handlers and `additionalRoutes` blocks) from growing
 * while extraction proceeds.
 *
 * It does NOT break existing routes on day one. Every route-bearing starter file
 * that exists today is baselined in scripts/route-ownership-baseline.json. The
 * check fails only on NEW drift:
 *   - a new route-bearing starter file with no ownership annotation,
 *   - more `/v1/...` route definitions in a baselined file than its baseline,
 *   - a new `additionalRoutes` block outside the allowed files.
 *
 * Escape hatch: a file carrying a `// voyant-route-owner: <reason>` annotation
 * is treated as an explicit ownership decision and is exempt from baseline
 * enforcement (it still appears in the report).
 *
 * As route families move into packages (RFC Phases 3-4), LOWER the baseline
 * counts in the JSON; the checker warns when a file drops below baseline so the
 * baseline is kept honest. Never raise a count to land new starter routes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-route-ownership.mjs            # enforce: fail on new drift
 *   node scripts/check-route-ownership.mjs --report   # report-only: never fail
