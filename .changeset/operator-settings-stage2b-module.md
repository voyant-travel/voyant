Promote `@voyant-travel/operator-settings` to a standard mounted module (Workstream B step 4, Stage 2b — completes the extraction).

- The package gains a HonoModule: `./hono-module` (`createOperatorSettingsHonoModule()`, lazyRoutes at the stable absolute paths `/v1/admin/settings/*`, `/v1/public/operator-profile`, `/v1/public/settings/operator`) + `./routes` (the handlers). New deps: `@voyant-travel/hono` + `hono`.
- It moves from `voyant.config` `additionalSchemas` → `modules`, so it joins the runtime/BOM **lockstep set (16 → 17)** and is added to the framework BOM `dependencies`. `FRAMEWORK_RUNTIME_MANIFEST` + `frameworkComposition` own its factory.
- The deployment drops `operator/operator-settings` from `deploymentLocalModules` (now only `invitations` remains) and **deletes** `src/api/routes/settings.ts` — the settings routes are package-owned.

Migration parity holds (schema byte-identical, already in snapshot 0067; `additionalSchemas`→`modules` only changes the schema's position in the drizzle list, not its DDL). Composed module/extension counts are unchanged (29 / 34 / 15) — the module just moved framework-owned. `check-public-cache-policy` updated to the package's new routes path.
