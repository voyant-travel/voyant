  Voyant ships deployable starter apps, package-owned background execution, and
  a wide set of headless domain modules (catalog, commerce, inventory, operations,
  relationships, quotes, bookings, finance, distribution, legal, charters,
  cruises, accommodation resale, and more) that you compose into your own
  travel platform.
</p>

## Getting started

Install the CLI, scaffold an app from a first-party starter, and run it locally.

```bash
# 1. Install the CLI
npm install -g @voyant-travel/cli

# 2. Scaffold a project from the operator starter
voyant new my-travel-app
cd my-travel-app
pnpm install

# 3. Configure the app
cp .env.example .env
# set your secrets (DATABASE_URL, BETTER_AUTH_ADMIN_SECRET, …) in .env

# 4. Run the app
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm dev
```

> `voyant new` scaffolds from the `operator` starter by default. Pass `--starter <name>` to pick another built-in starter (downloaded from GitHub Release assets for the matching CLI release), or point it at a custom local starter directory.

## What is Voyant?

Voyant is a framework for building travel commerce platforms. Instead of a
monolithic booking system, it gives you composable, headless domain modules
and deployable application shells that you own and extend.

- **Deployable application shells, not just isolated packages.** First-party
  starters ship as real, runnable apps.
- **A normalized travel operations data model** on PostgreSQL + Drizzle.
- **Headless domain modules** for catalog, commerce, inventory, operations,
  relationships, quotes, bookings, finance, distribution, legal, charters,
  cruises, accommodation resale, and more.
- **Hono-based API transport** with optional Next.js route helpers.
- **Package-owned subscribers and jobs** selected with their domain modules and
  hosted by self-managed infrastructure or Voyant Cloud.
- **Better Auth wiring** in first-party starters, with core packages staying
  auth-provider agnostic.
- **Versioned React packages per domain** (`relationships-react`,
  `inventory-react`, `commerce-react`, `bookings-react`, …) consumed as
  ordinary dependencies: hooks, clients, providers, query keys, and reusable
  UI that wrap each module's HTTP contract.
- **Optional integrations** for payments, e-invoicing, storage, CMS sync, and
  notifications.

Voyant supports accommodation as catalog inventory for resale, packaging, and
trip composition. It is not positioned as a hotel PMS or first-party
hotel-operations system. See
[`docs/architecture/accommodation-resale-boundary.md`](./docs/architecture/accommodation-resale-boundary.md).

## Starters

Voyant ships one first-party starter:

| Starter | Purpose | Stack |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`starters/operator`](./starters/operator/README.md) | Tour operator platform | Cloudflare Workers, TanStack Start, Hono, Better Auth, Drizzle |

### Background execution

Selected modules contribute the subscribers and jobs required for their
product behavior. Jobs are enabled by the standard managed and self-hosted
runtime and recover from domain-owned durable state. Customer-specific
automation consumes Voyant events and invokes authenticated domain APIs from
an external automation system.

### UI and React families

Reusable frontend surfaces live in the matching `-react` package for each
domain module. Those packages own hooks, clients, providers, query keys,
view-model helpers, reusable components, and `./ui` owner paths where needed.
For example, [`@voyant-travel/relationships-react`](./packages/relationships-react/README.md),
[`@voyant-travel/quotes-react`](./packages/quotes-react/README.md),
[`@voyant-travel/inventory-react`](./packages/inventory-react),
[`@voyant-travel/commerce-react`](./packages/commerce-react), and
[`@voyant-travel/bookings-react`](./packages/bookings-react). Bookings requirements
live under `@voyant-travel/bookings-react/requirements`; checkout UI lives under
`@voyant-travel/finance-react/checkout-ui`. The shared admin shell lives in
[`@voyant-travel/admin`](./packages/admin/README.md); cross-cutting primitives in
[`packages/ui`](./packages/ui/README.md).

### Plugins

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [`@voyant-travel/plugin-netopia`](https://github.com/voyant-travel/plugin-netopia) | Netopia payments |
| [`@voyant-travel/plugin-smartbill`](./packages/plugins/smartbill/README.md) | SmartBill e-invoicing (Romanian tax compliance) |
| [`@voyant-travel/plugin-payload-cms`](https://github.com/voyant-travel/plugin-payload) | Payload CMS sync |
| [`@voyant-travel/plugin-sanity-cms`](./packages/plugins/sanity-cms/README.md) | Sanity CMS sync |

## Architecture

Voyant keeps a strict boundary between reusable business logic and deployment shells:

- `packages/*` hold reusable business logic, schemas, services, routes, adapters, and contracts
- `starters/*` and app shells own UI, auth wiring, deployment shape, and runtime-specific configuration
- Core packages stay framework-agnostic even when first-party starters use React, TanStack Start, Hono, Better Auth, and Cloudflare Workers
- Transport adapters stay thin and call shared domain services rather than owning business logic
- Package manifests contribute required subscribers and jobs; deployment hosts provide their runtime infrastructure

Architecture decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](./docs/adr/); domain conventions
live in [`docs/architecture/`](./docs/architecture/); per-minor migration notes
live in [`docs/migrations/`](./docs/migrations/README.md).

### Security model

**One Postgres database + one runtime per organization.** Tenancy is enforced
at the deployment boundary, not by in-process middleware, so new package work
under `packages/*` should not add in-process tenant scoping. See
[ADR-0001](./docs/adr/0001-tenant-scoping.md) for the full rationale, the
alternatives considered, and the conditions under which the decision should be
revisited.

## Contributing

This repository is the workspace that powers the framework, starters, runners,
and examples.

| Area | What it contains |
| --- | --- |
| [`packages/*`](./packages) | Reusable business logic, schemas, services, transport adapters, and integrations |
| [`packages/plugins/*`](./packages/plugins) | First-party plugin bundles (payments, invoicing, CMS sync) |
| [`starters/*`](./starters) | First-party starter apps |
| [`apps/*`](./apps) | Reference/demo apps, the shadcn registry host, and agent workers |
| [`examples/operator-demo`](./examples/operator-demo/README.md) | Destructive and generated Operator demo fixtures |

### Monorepo commands

Voyant uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) workspaces and [Turborepo](https://turbo.build).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm install` | Install workspace dependencies |
| `pnpm build` | Build the workspace with Turborepo |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Run workspace typechecks |
| `pnpm test` | Run workspace tests |
| `pnpm test:bookings:integration` | Start or reuse the Docker test Postgres, ensure the bookings test schema, and run the bookings integration files serially |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Biome checks across the repo |
| `pnpm generate:schema-docs` | Regenerate [`SCHEMA.md`](./SCHEMA.md) from the Drizzle table definitions |
| `pnpm -F operator dev` | Start the operator starter on port `3300` |

### Integration test database

The shared Docker test Postgres is defined in
[`docker-compose.test.yml`](./docker-compose.test.yml).

- default host port: `5436`
- override with `TEST_DATABASE_PORT`
- override the full connection string with `TEST_DATABASE_URL`

For the bookings package, contributors can use:

```bash
pnpm test:bookings:integration
```

That helper starts or reuses the Docker test DB, applies starter migrations,
ensures the current additive bookings-session table exists, and runs the
bookings DB-backed integration files serially to avoid deadlocks from
concurrent table truncation.
