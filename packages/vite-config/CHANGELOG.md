# @voyant-travel/vite-config

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- 8d62a7c: Republish every affected TypeScript package without broken declaration maps so the corrected artifact
  policy reaches npm instead of applying only to future incidental package releases.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- d83d237: Repair packaged consumer development and production startup, keep shared UI
  contexts single-instanced under Vite, make unconfigured realtime quiet, and
  restore narrow client-safe validation and Finance voucher setup exports. Resolve
  legacy frontend imports through product-owned browser facades and allow clean CI
  installs to fetch metadata for external dependencies.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 2669577: Start production operator projects through their Vite-built TanStack server
  entry so virtual router imports and the React SSR singleton resolve from the
  generated server graph.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c65b05c: Generate standard Operator route registrations under `.voyant`, move public
  Finance and Quotes route behavior into package-owned contributions, and move
  standard route composition into the product distribution so application source
  contains only deployment adapters and local customization.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- c5a083b: Add a `nodeSsr` option to `voyantStartViteConfig` that folds in the load-bearing
  Node SSR build config — `ssr.target: "node"`, `ssr.noExternal` for
  `@voyant-travel/*` / `@pxmstudio/*`, and `ssr.resolve.conditions` (source-first)
  — which Node-only Voyant apps (voyant#2966) previously hand-merged on top of the
  preset.

  With `nodeSsr: true` a Voyant TanStack Start app's `vite.config.ts` shrinks to a
  single `voyantStartViteConfig(...)` call and copies no build config — the
  last piece the source-free managed admin host (voyant#3044) still duplicated.
  The operator and managed-operator starters adopt it.

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- d2d2a44: Anchor the React vendor chunk heuristic to actual `react`, `react-dom`, and `scheduler` package boundaries so third-party package internals such as Better Auth's `dist/client/react/*` subpaths stay out of the eager React chunk.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- a155321: Declare `rollup-plugin-visualizer` as an optional peer for the opt-in bundle analysis helper.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- ecec979: Improve operator bundle boundaries by adding route-local admin message provider support, exposing admin extension route helpers, keeping pending skeletons structural, and tightening Vite route ignores and vendor chunk splitting so heavy admin route dependencies stay out of the initial entry.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 2e716a2: New packages — Phase 0 of the packaged-admin RFC (#1643): framework-owned
  Worker infrastructure ships as versioned packages instead of copied template
  files.

  - `@voyant-travel/worker-runtime`: `createApiDispatch` (prefix-routed API/auth
    dispatch with lean-auth cold-start protection and background API warm-up),
    `createWorkerFetch` (API-vs-SSR Worker entrypoint), `lazyApp` (memoized app
    loaders), and `withActiveRouteSsrManifest` (restricts the TanStack Start SSR
    manifest to active route matches).
  - `@voyant-travel/vite-config`: `voyantStartViteConfig` build preset (vendor
    chunking, SSR optimizeDeps, `@` alias, dev-tunnel hosts) plus à-la-carte
    exports (`voyantVendorChunk`, `VOYANT_SSR_OPTIMIZE_DEPS`,
    `VOYANT_ROUTE_FILE_IGNORE_PATTERN`, `createAnalyzePlugin`).

  The operator template consumes both: `entry.ts` shrinks to bindings + factory
  calls (scheduled crons, the workflow Durable Object, and step services remain
  app-owned per RFC §4.4), and `vite.config.ts` shrinks to plugin instantiation.
