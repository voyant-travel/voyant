## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e9f77a: Add organization defaults and member overrides for stable admin navigation IDs. Apply visibility
  after selected navigation composition without exposing ineligible routes, inherit hidden parent
  state through navigation subtrees, and retain structural parents only when a child is explicitly
  re-enabled. Ship the persistence, admin API, provisioning seam, and settings UI in standard Operator
  deployments, with duplicate settings contributions normalized at the host and core boundaries.
