### Minor Changes

- 490d132: Add the generic Node outbound webhook delivery engine with Postgres persistence, visibility policy admission, HMAC signing, idempotent attempts, bounded retries, terminal dead-letter state, and auditable outcomes.
- 490d132: Provide validated subscription mutations, durable projected webhook enqueue, restart-safe payload storage, and one claim-driven signed, retrying, audited delivery worker.

### Patch Changes

  including generated graph admission, local and managed auth, API/admin serving,
  workflow services and schedules, outbound delivery, links, and runtime ports.
