### Minor Changes

- 9c909e2: Package-deliver the booking-flow admin surfaces (packaged-admin final sweep)

  - **bookings-react**: `createBookingsAdminExtension` now contributes the whole booking flow — three new route contributions alongside list/detail: `bookings-new` (`/bookings/new` owned-product picker that forwards into the unified journey; route-backed `booking.create` destination), `bookings-compose` (`/bookings/compose` legacy alias forwarding to the new `trip.create` destination), and `bookings-journey` (`/catalog/journey/$entityModule/$entityId`, the unified `BookingJourney` host with CRM-backed lead/traveler pickers, departure/units/voucher pickers, duplicate-departure warning, B2B default, and commit→`booking.detail` / cancel→`catalog.browse` navigation via semantic destinations). New exports: `bookingNewSearchSchema`, `bookingJourneySearchSchema` (+ param types) and the `BookingJourneyHost` admin module (`/admin/booking-journey-host`). Declares the `trip.create` destination key.
  - **admin**: `useAdminNavigate` accepts an optional `AdminNavigateOptions` (`{ replace?: boolean }`) third argument, forwarded to the host-injected navigate so packaged redirect pages keep route-redirect history semantics.
  - **admin-app**: the workspace shell's injected destination navigate maps `replace` onto the router's history-replace mode.

### Minor Changes

- 478aa7c: Packaged-admin RFC §4.8 endgame — the code-assembled extension route tree.
  Package-delivered admin pages exist as NO per-route files in the host: the
  operator deleted ~50 thin host route files across all 10 admin domains; the
  route tree for extension routes is assembled in code from the contributions
  and grafted under the file-based workspace layout, with typed links intact.

  - `@voyantjs/admin`: `AdminUiRouteContribution` grows `page?: () =>
Promise<AdminRoutePageModule>` — a lazy page-module loader (pages stay
    code-split, hover/intent preloading fetches the chunk ahead of
    navigation). The resolved component receives `AdminRoutePageProps`
    (`params`/`search`/`updateSearch`/`title`), dissolving the old "zero-prop
    components only" restriction — param-taking detail pages need no host
    route file. `AdminRouteLoaderContext` gains `params`. New helpers:
    `requireImplementedAdminRoute` (loud failure at module evaluation when a
    bound contribution loses its implementation) and `adminRoutePageModule`
    (adapter for zero-prop / all-optional-prop hosts).
  - `@voyantjs/admin-app`: new binder — `adminExtensionRouteOptions(extension,
routeId, runtime)` returns router-facing route options (lazy component,
    loader bound to `{ queryClient, runtime, params }`, per-route `ssr`,
    boundaries) ready to spread into a code-based `createRoute({...})`, and
    `attachAdminExtensionRoutes(routeTree, parentRoute, routes)` grafts the
    built routes under the workspace layout idempotently (replace-by-path,
    dev-server re-evaluation safe).
  - All 10 `*-react` admin extensions now carry full route implementations:
    lazy `page` loaders (dynamic imports of the specific host modules, never
    the admin barrel), loaders moved verbatim from the operator route files
    (SSR modes preserved exactly, `data-only` included), pending skeletons,
    and search contracts. Bookings adds host-composition options
    (`indexHeaderActions`, `detailPageComponent` + exported
    `BookingDetailPageComponentProps`) so app-owned composition rides through
    the factory instead of a route file. Finance's supplier-invoices pages
    stay metadata-only (app-owned upload/supplier-picker/cross-domain search
    wiring) and remain host route files.

  Hosts bind everything in one checked-in generated module
  (`src/admin.routes.generated.tsx`): per route a `createRoute` call with the
  path literal + typed search schema, spreading the binder options, plus
  `AdminExtensionRoutesBy*` typed-link maps that `router.tsx` merges with the
  generated `FileRouteTypes` via `_addFileTypes` — `Link`/`navigate` stay
  fully typed for file routes and extension routes alike.

### Minor Changes

- 4ade734: Semantic admin navigation destinations (packaged-admin RFC §4.7): packaged
  admin pages navigate to routes they don't own (booking journey, supplier
  detail, product editor) without importing a host route tree.

  - `@voyantjs/admin`: new `AdminDestinations` interface (augmented by domain
    packages via `declare module "@voyantjs/admin"`), `AdminNavigationProvider`,
    and `useAdminHref`/`useAdminNavigate`. Unresolvable keys warn once per key
    and degrade to `"#"`/no-op — never a throw in render paths.
  - `@voyantjs/admin-app`: `AdminWorkspaceShell` accepts a `destinations`
    resolver map (`satisfies AdminDestinationResolvers` for exhaustiveness) and
    mounts the provider wired to the app router via `router.navigate({ href })`.
  - `@voyantjs/catalog-ui`: declares the catalog destination keys
    (`bookingJourney.start`, `catalog.browse`, `catalog.detail`,
    `product.detail`, `supplier.detail`) covering every cross-route target the
    operator's catalog wrappers navigate to.

- db98e90: New package — Phase 1 of the packaged-admin RFC (#1643): the admin
  application composition ships as a versioned package; `@voyantjs/admin` stays
  the primitives layer.

  - `createAdminRouter` / `createAdminQueryClient` — TanStack Router +
    QueryClient with the Voyant defaults (intent preloading with matched
    staleTime, scroll restoration, default not-found page, QueryClient SSR
    dehydrate/hydrate).
  - `adminRootHead` / `AdminRootShell` / `AdminRootErrorBoundary` — root route
    internals, including the pre-hydration theme/locale bootstrap script and a
    provider-independent error boundary.
  - `createAdminWorkspaceBeforeLoad` — the workspace auth guard (beforeLoad so
    the redirect short-circuits child loaders).
  - `AdminWorkspaceShell` — bootstrap gate → per-user message overrides →
    locale sync → workspace layout, with the Slot-compatible `AdminRouterLink`
    as the default nav link.

  The operator template consumes it: `router.tsx` (89→15 LOC), `__root.tsx`
  (118→29), and `_workspace/route.tsx` (209→95) shrink to wiring; app-owned
  parts (provider list, extension definitions, nav icons, auth client) stay in
  the template.
