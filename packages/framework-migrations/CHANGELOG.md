# @voyant-travel/framework-migrations

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- c5d4b20: Harden the managed custom-module migration path (voyant#3069 follow-ups).

  - `loadModuleBundleSource` now resolves ESM-only ("import"-only `exports`)
    packages. `require.resolve` applies the CommonJS `require` condition and throws
    `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` for import-only packages (the repo's publish
    shape), which silently skipped a schema-owning package's committed
    `migrations/`. It now falls back to a `node_modules` package-root walk that
    ignores export conditions when `require.resolve` rejects.
  - `customSource` is now validated: `validateVoyantProject` rejects a non-object
    `customSource` or a non-string-array `customSource.modules`/`.extensions`, and
    `getVoyantProjectMigrationMetadata` defensively coerces the value before
    deriving migration sources — so a malformed snapshot (e.g. a string instead of
    an array) no longer yields one "package" per character.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- b9f3608: Give source-free managed images a migration path for custom schema-owning
  modules (voyant#3069, Option 1 — modules ship pre-built migrations).

  A managed image runs migrations with no drizzle-kit generation, so a custom
  "bring-your-own" module that owns schema previously had no way to create its
  tables. It now does, following the same per-package `migrations/` convention
  standard packages already use.

  `@voyant-travel/framework-migrations`:

  - `loadModuleBundleSource(packageName, { priority, resolveFrom })` — resolve a
    module package's committed `migrations/` folder by name into a
    `MigrationSource`, or `null` when it ships none (schema-less modules/plugins
    are skipped). Ledger source name is the unscoped package name, stable across
    source and managed modes.
  - `collectManagedMigrationSources({ modulePackages, resolveFrom })` — the
    managed migration path: `[framework, ...customModules]` deps-first, ready for
    `runDeploymentMigrations`.

  `@voyant-travel/framework`:

  - `getVoyantProjectMigrationMetadata(project)` now returns
    `moduleSources: { packageName, priority }[]` derived from the snapshot's
    `customSource.modules`, so the platform migrate booter enumerates the custom
    schema-owning packages to apply after the framework bundle. Adds the
    `VoyantProfileModuleMigrationSource` type.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 01346a6: Add the missing `cloud_auth_user_links.scopes` column to the shipped framework
  migration bundle so managed Cloud admin auth can persist Cloud-granted member
  scopes during sign-in and revalidation. The matching db-package migration now
  uses `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, with a narrow collector hash compatibility
  exception for deployments that already recorded the original equivalent
  migration. The package-baseline oracle also keeps its bundle comparison pinned
  to the frozen D.2 cutover bundle so post-cutline framework increments do not
  make fresh-package union checks compare against schema they intentionally
  exclude.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- 6c1d9bc: Run a compatibility preflight before the inventory product-days uniqueness migration so existing duplicate itinerary day numbers are deterministically renumbered before the unique index is created.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- 40036f5: Fix migration source discovery for schema manifests that contain `file://` URLs, so published starters resolve package-owned `migrations/` folders from installed `@voyant-travel` packages.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c70e7b8: Clean up D.1/D.2 transition scaffolding from the migration collector's public API now that there's a single model.

  - **`applyD2Migrations` → `applyMigrations`** (the one collector apply path). `cutline`/`existing` are now optional fields on `ApplyMigrationsOptions` — with neither, it simply executes every pending migration; with both, it import-baselines the cutline on an existing DB. Returns `{ executed, baselined }`.
  - **Removed** the now-redundant legacy `applyMigrations` (simple) + `importBaseline` + `ApplyD2MigrationsOptions` — the unified `applyMigrations` subsumes them.
  - Internal: `scripts/d2/` → `scripts/migrations/`; `verify:d2-*` → `verify:migration-*`; comments/test identifiers dropped the `D.1`/`D.2` labels.

  BREAKING: consumers of `applyD2Migrations`/`importBaseline` should call `applyMigrations`. The deployment-facing API (`runDeploymentMigrations`, `discoverMigrationSources`, `loadCutline`, `loadMigrationFolder`) is unchanged.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- 9cff1d9: D.2 parity-check correctness fixes (found validating real legacy→D.2 deployment transitions on Neon production-copy branches):

  - **`expectedSchema` now honors `ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN`** — a column added by an earlier migration and dropped by a later one (e.g. a deployment experiment later reverted) is no longer expected at baseline. Without this the import-baseline parity check demanded 31 columns that a deployment had deliberately dropped.
  - **`expectedSchema` now honors `ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN`** — a renamed column is expected under its NEW name, not the original the baseline declared (e.g. a deployment that renames a package column).
  - The parity-failure error no longer recommends `drizzle-kit push` (unsafe in production); it explains that a behind database must reach the cutline via its normal migration path, or be dropped + FRESH-migrated if disposable, and clarifies that import-baseline only records the cutline — it never alters schema.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 7b377bc: Export a portable D.2 deployment runner so any deployment (not just the monorepo operator) can adopt package-owned migrations.

  - `discoverMigrationSources(schemaPaths, { baseDir, deploymentMigrationsDir })` — resolves each package's shipped `migrations/` folder from the generated schema list, topologically ordered by `voyant.requiresSchemas`. Layout-agnostic: handles both the monorepo `…/packages/<dir>/…` paths and installed `…/node_modules/@voyant-travel/<name>/…` (incl. pnpm `.pnpm/…`) paths, so npm-consuming deployments resolve the same sources the operator does.
  - `runDeploymentMigrations(client, sources, cutline)` + `detectExisting` / `assertSchemaAtBaseline` / `expectedSchema` — the FRESH-vs-EXISTING dual-path engine (import-baseline the cutline on a pre-D.2 DB, gated by a schema-parity check), extracted from the operator so deployments share one tested implementation instead of copying it.

  The operator's `scripts/migrate.ts` now imports these from the package; its local copies were removed.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 3acd772: Add the D.2 dual-path collector engine. `applyD2Migrations(client, sources, { cutline, existing })` applies per-package + deployment sources, import-baselining cutline-covered migrations on an existing database (record-without-execute) while executing fresh databases and post-cutline increments — the retired framework bundle's `framework/*` rows are left as inert history. `loadCutline()` reads the shipped `cutline.generated.json`. The operator migrate runner is rewired to use these in a follow-up.

### Patch Changes

- 435a5d1: Extract the availability domain into a new foundational `@voyant-travel/availability` package, and complete D.2 per-package migration onboarding for the last schema-owning packages.

  - **@voyant-travel/availability (new):** owns the `availability_*` schema (slots, rules, start times, holds, pickups, capacity) — previously buried in operations. Ships its own D.2 migration.
  - **operations:** its availability **services and routes stay**, now importing the schema from `@voyant-travel/availability` (the barrel re-exports it for runtime consumers); operations' migration no longer owns the availability tables. Fixes the module direction — bookings/operations/accommodations consume availability, rather than reaching into operations for an inventory primitive.
  - **bookings:** drops the hard cross-package FK from `booking_allocations.availability_slot_id` to `availability_slots` (it referenced a stale local duplicate); the column is now a plain indexed id per module decoupling. The refund workflow keeps a runtime-only reference to the availability table.
  - **framework-migrations:** bundle migration drops the removed FK constraint.

  All package sources verified column-for-column against the bundle and apply together cleanly on a fresh D.2 database (union).

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 84b9d4b: legal: remove cross-package foreign-key constraints from `contracts` and `contract_signatures` (`person_id → relationships.people`, `organization_id → relationships.organizations`, `supplier_id → distribution.suppliers`). These horizontal cross-module associations now follow the module-decoupling pattern — plain id columns + `defineLink` at the deployment (person/organization/supplier ↔ contract) + service-layer validation — instead of hard cross-package FKs. The `person_id`/`organization_id`/`supplier_id` columns and their indexes are unchanged; only the FK constraints are dropped. `createContract`/`updateContract` now validate that referenced person/organization/supplier ids exist (400 on a stale/mistyped id), preserving the integrity the FK used to enforce.

  framework-migrations: bundle migration drops the four legal cross-package FK constraints so the shipped bundle matches the decoupled schema. (The deployment migrate runner's baseline-import guard now also verifies dropped constraints are actually gone before importing — so existing deployments can't silently baseline this constraint drop without applying it.)

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- a74471e: Add the new `quotes` columns + `quote_media` table to the standard migration bundle: `quotes.pax_count`, `quotes.created_by` / `quotes.updated_by`, `quotes.description`, and the `quote_media` table (quote images/attachments shown on the proposal).

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 76b18b5: Add `importBaseline(client, sources, options?)` — records a planned set of migrations in the `_voyant_migrations` ledger **without executing their SQL**, for cutting an existing deployment (whose schema is already materialised) onto the collector. Idempotent (`ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`); the caller must verify schema parity first. The shared ledger DDL is factored into one `ensureLedger` helper used by both `applyMigrations` and `importBaseline`.

  This is the collector primitive behind the D.1 runner cutover (slice 4): `migrate.ts` now auto-detects FRESH (execute) / BASELINE (import) / INCREMENTAL (apply-new), with baseline gated by a parity guard. See `docs/architecture/migration-collector-d1.md`.

- 3fbff52: Ship the D.1 standard-profile aggregate migration bundle (Workstream D.1, slice 2). `@voyant-travel/framework-migrations` now includes the generated `migrations/` bundle (`0000_framework_baseline`) — the standard-profile aggregate schema (the operator reference profile's package-owned schemas, minus the deployment-local cross-module link tables) — and exports `loadFrameworkBundleSource()` / `frameworkBundleDir()` to load it as the `framework` collector source (priority 0).

  The bundle is incremental: `0000` is frozen; a standard-schema change appends `0001…` (never rewrites `0000`, which would trip the collector's content-hash immutability guard). `scripts/generate-framework-migration-bundle.mjs` generates it (from the operator reference config) and gates drift via `verify:framework-migration-bundle` (added to `verify:architecture`) — a clean re-generate must be a no-op. This slice ships + verifies the bundle; it is not yet wired into a live runner (slice 4).

- 8a8737f: New package `@voyant-travel/framework-migrations` — the D.1 multi-source migration collector (Workstream D, foundation slice). Productionizes the validated `spikes/d1-migration-collector` approach:

  - `planMigrations` / `applyMigrations` — apply migrations across ordered sources (framework bundle first, then the deployment's own) via one **version-independent** ledger keyed by `(source, tag, content_hash)`. Idempotent re-runs, framework-first ordering, per-migration transactions, drizzle `--> statement-breakpoint` splitting, and **content-hash immutability** (`MigrationImmutabilityError` if a shipped migration changed after it was applied).
  - `loadMigrationFolder` — read a drizzle `migrations/` folder (`meta/_journal.json` + `*.sql`) into ordered statements.

  Transport-agnostic (takes an injected pg-compatible client; no `pg` dependency in the library). Integration tests reproduce the spike's 5 scenarios against Postgres (skipped when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset). This slice does **not** change any live migration runner — see `docs/architecture/migration-collector-d1.md` for the ADR and the remaining slices (bundle generation, replay oracle, runner cutover).

### Patch Changes

- 04681f3: Adopt custom fields on `booking` — the first entity consumer of the `@voyant-travel/core/custom-fields` registry.

  - A `custom_fields jsonb default '{}'` column on `bookings` (framework bundle migration `0001`).
  - Booking create/update routes validate the `customFields` payload at the boundary against the deployment's injected registry (`validateBookingCustomFields`): unknown keys, missing required, and wrong types are rejected 400; only registry-approved values are persisted. Writes that carry `customFields` when the deployment declares none are rejected.
  - The registry is injected through `BookingRouteRuntimeOptions.customFields` → `createBookingsHonoModule` → a new optional `FrameworkProviders.customFields` provider, which a deployment supplies (the operator wires its discovered `operatorCustomFields`).

  Read paths return `custom_fields` as part of the booking row. Oracle-verified (`bundle + links == live schema`). Per-entity adoption continues with `person`/`product`; export/invoice/search consumption of `customFieldsVisibleIn` is a follow-up. See `docs/architecture/custom-fields.md`.

- 9c3fe53: Custom-fields unification (phase 2 — person/organization adopt the `custom_fields` column). Both `people` and `organizations` gain a `custom_fields jsonb default '{}'` column (framework bundle migration `0002`), and their create/update routes validate `customFields` at the write boundary against the resolved registry (code ∪ runtime `custom_field_definitions`):

  - `relationships`: `RelationshipsRouteRuntime(+Options).customFields` resolver; a `validateRelationshipsCustomFields(c, entity, data)` helper on the accounts route (its `Env` now exposes `container`); person/org writes persist the cleaned value.
  - `relationships-contracts`: `customFields` added to the person/organization core schemas.
  - `framework`: the relationships factory moves Tier 1 → 2 to receive `capabilities.customFields`.

  Values now live on the entity row for `booking`, `person`, and `organization`. Still ahead: repoint the EAV value API to the column + backfill `custom_field_values` → jsonb, then retire the side table. Oracle-verified (bundle + links == live schema).

- d29dd47: Custom-fields unification (phase 3a — `custom_fields` column on quote + activity). `activities` (relationships) and `quotes` gain a `custom_fields jsonb default '{}'` column (framework bundle migration `0003`), completing entity coverage for all four EAV entity types (person, organization, quote, activity) ahead of repointing the value API to the column. Additive — no behavior change yet. Oracle-verified.
- ce2a568: Custom-fields unification (phase 4a — retire `custom_field_values`). The EAV value side table is removed; values live solely on each entity's `custom_fields` jsonb column.

  - The table + its types/relations are dropped from the schema; the person/org merge flow now merges `custom_fields` (keeper wins) instead of value rows.
  - A **guarded** retirement migration (framework bundle `0004`) drops the table but **RAISES if it still has rows**, so a deployment that hasn't run the backfill fails the migration loudly instead of losing data. The backfill script gains `--clear` to copy values into the columns and then empty the table.

  **Upgrade order:** `tsx scripts/backfill-custom-fields.ts --clear` (copies + empties), then `voyant db migrate` (the guarded drop). Verified: guard refuses with rows, drops when empty; oracle balances.

- d9e5f8e: Correct the D.1 framework bundle so it applies cleanly to a blank database: include the `cruise_air_arrangement` enum (via the cruises barrel fix) and inject the `pg_trgm` + `unaccent` extension preamble that the standard schema's trigram/unaccent indexes need (drizzle-kit only auto-generates `postgis`). The bundle's `0000_framework_baseline` now applies end-to-end against Postgres.
- 1132d2a: Stop shipping drizzle-kit `meta/*_snapshot.json` files in the published package. The bundle loader (`loadFrameworkBundleSource` → `loadMigrationFolder`) only reads `meta/_journal.json` + the `*.sql` files at runtime; the per-migration snapshots are build-time drift-detection artifacts used only inside the repo. Narrowing `files` to `dist`, `migrations/*.sql`, and `migrations/meta/_journal.json` cuts the published package from ~9.8 MB unpacked (469 kB tarball) to ~0.53 MB (60 kB) with no runtime change.
