/**
 * Pure, transport-agnostic logic for mapping travelers onto option_units
 * at booking-create time. Lives in `@voyantjs/bookings` so the
 * booking-create dialog (preview + submit) is the only call site today,
 * but the server can import the same module to validate or re-resolve
 * submit payloads in a follow-up — that wiring is not yet in place.
 *
 * Vocabulary:
 *   - A **pricing tier** (`unit_type='person'`) is a per-pax price band
 *     a traveler is billed as (Adult / Child 6-12 / Infant 0-5 / …).
 *   - An **inventory unit** (`'room' | 'vehicle' | 'seat'`) is a finite
 *     container a traveler is placed into (one DBL room holds 2 pax).
 *   - "Person-priced options" are options that only have pricing tiers
 *     (no inventory). Excursions. For these, line-item quantities
 *     **derive from the traveler list** (1 adult + 1 child + 1 infant).
 *   - "Accommodation options" have inventory units (and usually a
 *     paired person unit for per-pax fees). For these, line-item
 *     quantities **stay as the operator picked them** (1 DBL room is
 *     still 1 line, not 2).
 *
 * The `pricingUnitSource` and `inventoryUnitSource` enums on the
 * traveler track operator intent so the resolver knows when to
 * re-derive ("auto") versus respect an explicit choice ("manual" /
 * "none" for No room).
 *
 * No React, no DB, no HTTP — just the assignment math.
 *
 * Tracking: voyantjs/voyant#1267.
