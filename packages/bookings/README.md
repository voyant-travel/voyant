# @voyant-travel/bookings

Bookings module for Voyant. Manages booking lifecycle with travelers, supplier statuses, activity log, and notes. Uses `personId` + `organizationId` from CRM as client snapshot.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @voyant-travel/bookings
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { bookingsModule } from "@voyant-travel/bookings"
import { createApp } from "@voyant-travel/hono"

const app = createApp({
  modules: [bookingsModule],
  // ...
})
```

## Public storefront flow

The public routes include:

- `POST /v1/public/bookings/sessions`
- `GET /v1/public/bookings/sessions/:sessionId`
- `PUT /v1/public/bookings/sessions/:sessionId/state`
- `POST /v1/public/bookings/sessions/:sessionId/reprice`
- `GET /v1/public/bookings/overview`

Session reads now include first-class persisted wizard state, and repricing
supports both preview mode and `applyToSession` mode for committing the priced
room/unit selection back onto the booking session totals.

## Origin and provenance

Bookings owns durable booking origin records in `booking_origins`. The origin
row is keyed by `booking_id` and can point at accepted Quote Versions, Trip
snapshots, reservation plans, Catalog price/availability responses, Catalog
booking snapshots, provider/source order refs, and legacy migrated transaction
ids. New booking flows should write this owner path instead of
the retired booking-to-transaction detail join.

## Action-ledger approvals

Agent/workflow booking status mutations that require approval return `202` with
the requested action and approval ids. These approval-required requests must
send `Idempotency-Key`; the key is fingerprinted with the command input and
approval policy inputs, so replaying the key with different input returns a
conflict.

After an approval is approved, execute the same status mutation again with the
`ACTION_LEDGER_APPROVAL_ID_HEADER` header from `@voyant-travel/action-ledger`. The
route validates that the approval is approved, unexpired, linked to the same
requested action and current principal, and command-equivalent to the original
request before it mutates the booking. Approved execution ledger fields are
stamped through `buildActionLedgerApprovedExecutionFields(...)` so execution
entries consistently link back to the requested action and approval.

## Agent Tools

The selected deployment graph exposes package-owned Tools from
`@voyant-travel/bookings/tools`:

- `reserve_booking` creates an on-hold booking and holds the requested
  availability with `bookings:write` only. The handler fingerprints the complete
  reservation command, writes the canonical `booking.reserve` action ledger
  entries in the booking transaction, and returns the immutable booking
  reference for exact idempotent replays.
- `cancel_booking` always enters the action-ledger approval flow for agent
  callers. Its first call returns a pending approval; execution requires the
  approved id and the same command, principal, target snapshot, and
  idempotency fingerprint. The successful cancellation ledger entry links to
  that requested action and approval, including financial-settlement hooks.
- `@voyant-travel/bookings#extras` owns booking-extra reads and non-destructive
  lifecycle writes plus staff-only departure manifests, traveler selections,
  and collection-state updates. Manifest reads require both `bookings:read` and
  `bookings-pii:read`; high-risk writes require explicit confirmation and are
  ledgered by their selected graph actions.
- `@voyant-travel/bookings#requirements` owns product/option requirement,
  question, choice, trigger, and booking-answer reads and non-destructive
  writes. Booking-answer reads require the explicit booking PII scope.
- `get_public_transport_requirements` is the public-safe requirements summary
  for staff or customer grants. It resolves the selected Inventory runtime port
  instead of importing or selecting a deployment provider directly.

Delete operations remain API-only until a deployment selects a destructive
Tool policy. Every Tool uses the request-scoped database/service contribution;
missing services or runtime ports fail closed.
