/**
 * Booking-confirmed redemption subscriber — records one row per
 * (offer, booking) in `promotional_offer_redemptions` after a booking
 * commits, by reading `pricing_applied_offers` from `catalog_quotes`
 * (joined to the booking via the existing `consumed_booking_id` column).
 *
 * Why a subscriber rather than a `BookEntityDeps` hook: `bookEntity`
 * does sequential writes without an enclosing `db.transaction(...)`,
 * and the owned `createBooking` path opens its own transaction in
 * `@voyant-travel/finance`. There is no single commit transaction to be
 * atomic with — claiming "atomic with commit" would be misleading.
 *
 * Per docs/architecture/promotions-architecture.md §3.6 + §7.3.
 *
 * The recorder reads from `catalog_quotes` (the source of truth, written
 * by `quoteEntity`) NOT from `booking_catalog_snapshot` to avoid an
 * ordering race with the catalog-bridge's `captureSnapshotGraph`
 * subscriber (both fire on the same `booking.confirmed` event).
 *
 * Idempotent on retry: the unique `(offer_id, booking_id)` index on
 * `promotional_offer_redemptions` (per §4.3) lets the upsert refresh the
 * aggregate cleanly even if the subscriber is replayed.
