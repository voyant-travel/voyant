/**
 * `@voyant-travel/media` graph runtime — the package-owned adapter from the
 * deployment port registry to the media-library admin route factory.
 *
 * A deployment selects this module; the framework resolves the `"media"`
 * object-storage provider through the storage runtime port
 * (`storageMediaRuntimePort` → `resolveStorage`) and this factory injects it
 * into `createMediaLibraryApiModule`. Mirrors the storage
 * `createStorageVoyantRuntime` seam (routes stay absolute + lazy; only the
 * resolved provider is threaded in).
