# @voyant-travel/finance-contracts

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- d2d7384: Expose provider-neutral finance issuance hydration, external-reference writeback,
  and invoice/proforma issuance webhooks through the remote App API boundary.

## 0.106.2

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [52352c4]
  - @voyant-travel/schema-kit@0.113.0

## 0.106.1

### Patch Changes

- 8d62a7c: Republish every affected TypeScript package without broken declaration maps so the corrected artifact
  policy reaches npm instead of applying only to future incidental package releases.
- Updated dependencies [8d62a7c]
  - @voyant-travel/schema-kit@0.112.1

## 0.106.0

### Minor Changes

- bbe6396: Replace the overloaded Finance voucher domain with Travel Credits across the
  database schema, APIs, package exports, booking inputs, storefront settings,
  and operator UI. Redemption commands are replay-safe, codes are normalized and
  case-insensitively unique, and legacy records migrate in place without silently
  skipping invalid balances. Keep Promotion Codes in Commerce and move Bookings
  fulfillment to the explicit Service Voucher vocabulary.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [bbe6396]
  - @voyant-travel/schema-kit@0.112.0

## 0.105.9

### Patch Changes

- bcd76ae: Reject invalid or dangling pricing and tax reference-data before writing.
  `POST /v1/admin/pricing/price-schedules` now rejects a nonexistent
  `priceCatalogId` with a deterministic `invalid_reference` 400 instead of a 500.
  Tax regime rates are bounded to the 0..100 percent domain (matching the
  booking-tax calculator that divides by 100), and `POST
/v1/admin/finance/tax-policy-rules` rejects dangling `profileId`/`taxRegimeId`
  references with an `invalid_reference` 400 (mirroring the existing tax-class
  regime guard).

## 0.105.8

### Patch Changes

- 3fc4487: Reject invalid booking-item finance subresource states: negative tax-line amounts, incomplete commission value bases, paid commissions without paid metadata, and deletion of active booking guarantees.
- aa0135c: Reject zero-value payment authorization and payment capture requests in payment-processing validation.
- 51003c6: Expose booking voucher redemptions in booking-scoped payment reads as voucher payment rows.

## 0.105.7

### Patch Changes

- d1b4da2: Preserve proforma conversion linkage while checkout finalization issues final invoices so invoice-issued subscribers can convert existing provider estimates instead of creating standalone invoices.

## 0.105.6

### Patch Changes

- 7bdd9cc: Honor `active=false` tax-class list filters and reject tax classes that reference unknown tax regimes.

## 0.105.5

### Patch Changes

- 5d94caa: Republish the validation entrypoints with the payment-processing body schema exports required by finance routes.

## 0.105.0

### Minor Changes

- 51f7dea: Share one list-response contract instead of per-module copies (voyant#2109).

  `@voyant-travel/types` now owns the canonical offset-paginated list envelope: the `ListResponse<T>` type + `listResponse(data, { total, limit, offset })` builder, plus the zod `paginationSchema` (coerced `limit` 1–200 default 50, `offset` ≥0 default 0) and the `listResponseSchema(item)` factory. Both server services and `*-react` clients import from this single source.

  Server side: every module's local `paginate()` / inline `{ data, total, limit, offset }` construction now routes through the shared `listResponse` builder, and the count read is standardized on `count` internally — fixing the drift where finance, notifications and the legal contracts/policies services read `countResult[0]?.total` while every other module read `countResult[0]?.count` (their `count(*)` selects were aliased `total`; they are now aliased `count`). The returned shape is byte-for-byte identical.

  Client side: the ~23 copied `paginatedEnvelope` zod schemas across the `*-react` packages are replaced by re-exporting the shared `listResponseSchema` factory under the same `paginatedEnvelope` name, so consumers are unchanged.

  Input alignment: `finance-contracts` and `legal-contracts` pagination `limit` caps were raised from `.max(100)` to `.max(200)` to match the framework-wide max.

  Additive and non-breaking.

### Patch Changes

- 9e970a5: Move checkout collection orchestration and React payment collection surfaces
  behind Finance owner paths. The old Checkout workspace packages are removed
  from the v1 branch while payment plugins, storefront SDK helpers, and the
  operator starter retarget Finance checkout interfaces.
- b711b04: Reject generic payment `orderId` request fields and keep legacy order references behind explicit `legacyOrderId` targets.

## 0.104.2

### Patch Changes

- cfa6af8: feat(finance): accounts-payable supplier invoices, profitability & end-to-end FX

  Adds the full accounts-payable vertical for #1506:

  - **Supplier invoices (AP)**: `supplier_invoices` / `supplier_invoice_lines` /
    `supplier_cost_allocations`, the `supplierInvoicesService` (create/update/
    setLines/setAllocations/payments), attachments, and admin API routes.
  - **Cost allocation**: two-step product → departure picker, configurable cost
    categories (managed under Settings), searchable comboboxes.
  - **Profitability**: per-departure / per-product / per-traveller P&L read model
    - dashboards, cost-by-category breakdown, charts, CSV export.
  - **Accountant share portal**: scoped, revocable token links (no login) exposing
    financials + client/supplier invoices with downloadable attachments, ZIP
    download, and an en/ro language switcher.
  - **End-to-end FX**: supplier invoices and cost allocations snapshot their
    accounting-base value at the FX rate effective on the issue date; the
    profitability rollup sums those recorded snapshots (per-transaction-date
    rates) instead of re-valuing aggregates at the latest rate.

  Supporting additive exports: `availability`/`bookings`/`suppliers` schema and
  linkable exports consumed by the finance read model, and new TypeID prefixes in
  `schema-kit`.

### Minor Changes

- 7094c8e: Add `@voyant-travel/schema-kit` and extend the `*-contracts` pattern to the
  operational modules.

  `@voyant-travel/schema-kit` (pure: zod + typeid-js) is the new foundational home for
  schema primitives shared by the runtime and the contract packages — the TypeID
  system (prefix registry, id generation, zod validators), `booleanQueryParam`,
  and `kmsEnvelopeSchema`. These moved out of `@voyant-travel/db` (which now re-exports
  them from their original paths, so every call-site is unchanged) so they sit
  below the data layer and the contract packages can depend on them without
  pulling Drizzle.

  New zod-only contract packages own each module's validation surface (schemas +
  enums): `@voyant-travel/bookings-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/finance-contracts`,
  `@voyant-travel/crm-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/transactions-contracts`,
  `@voyant-travel/suppliers-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/identity-contracts`, and
  `@voyant-travel/legal-contracts`. Each runtime module re-exports from its contracts
  package, so existing `@voyant-travel/<module>/validation` import paths are unchanged.
  Shared primitives come from `@voyant-travel/schema-kit`, keeping the contract
  packages free of the data layer.

  (`legal-contracts` still transitively depends on `@voyant-travel/utils` for the
  template-syntax validator used by contract validation — a tracked follow-up
  would purify it.)
