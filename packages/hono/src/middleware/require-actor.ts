/**
 * Guards a route surface by actor type.
 *
 * Voyant exposes two API surfaces:
 * - `/v1/admin/*` — operator staff (`"staff"`)
 * - `/v1/public/*` — customers, partners, suppliers
 *
 * Requests carry an `actor` on `c.var`, typically set by `requireAuth` or a
 * custom `auth.resolve` integration. Internal requests
 * (`isInternalRequest === true`) bypass the check.
 *
 * When the caller has no resolved actor, this middleware returns `401
 * Unauthorized`. Earlier versions defaulted unset callers to `"staff"` for
 * backwards compatibility, but that meant a misordered or missing auth
 * middleware silently granted operator privileges to anonymous traffic.
 * The default is now fail-closed.
 *
 * @example
 * app.use("/v1/admin/*", requireActor("staff"))
 * app.use("/v1/public/*", requireActor("customer", "partner", "supplier"))
