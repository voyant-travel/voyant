## 0.122.1

### Patch Changes

- 772439e: Wire the managed profile runtime to the Voyant Cloud admin auth flow. Managed
  Cloud apps now install the Cloud Better Auth plugin, resolve Better Auth cookie
  sessions with Cloud revalidation, revalidate Cloud-backed API-key users, and
  redirect unauthenticated admin UI requests into the Cloud sign-in flow while
  leaving API callers on JSON 401 responses.

  Add an optional `onUnauthorized` hook to the Hono auth integration contract so
  deployments can customize the final unauthenticated response after all shared
  credential strategies fail.

## 0.122.0

### Minor Changes

- 425f92e: Add Node-native cache and shared-state providers behind the existing KVStore
  surface, including in-process LRU, tiered Redis/Postgres providers, Postgres

  selection without KV-shaped binding requirements.

## 0.121.3

### Patch Changes

- bbefc34: Add lazy provider and lazy Hono bundle helpers so deployments can keep heavy
  provider/plugin service graphs out of the eager app closure while preserving
  request-time route, bootstrap, subscriber, and anonymous webhook behavior.
  Lazy bundles can also declare eager transactional module/path metadata so the
  first request selects the transaction-capable DB before the bundle is imported.

  Narrow the framework relationships provider surface to the async methods the
  framework consumes, so lazy provider call sites do not proxy query-builder or
  plain-property service members.

## 0.121.1

### Patch Changes

- 32d0e1c: Split the framework standard runtime composition into lightweight per-module
  lazy route loaders, and allow overlapping lazy route mounts to fall through on
  wrapper route misses so lazy modules/extensions preserve eager route composition
  semantics without swallowing handler-authored 404 responses.

## 0.121.0

### Minor Changes

- c9a356f: Extend the api-key permission grammar for fine-grained agent operations and carry
  an audience on the key grant.

  - `@voyant-travel/types`: add `cancel`/`refund`/`void`/`publish`/`send` actions and
    `dashboard`/`content`/`media`/`bookings-pii` resources (with descriptor groups);
    PII resources are never satisfied by the `*` wildcard; add `assertKnownPermissions`
    and `API_KEY_GRANT_PRESETS` (a scope subset bundled with an audience).
  - `@voyant-travel/core`: add `audience` to `VoyantAuthContext`.
  - `@voyant-travel/hono`: derive an API key's audience from its grant metadata and let
    the request actor follow it (replacing the hardcoded staff default).
  - `@voyant-travel/auth`: validate permission strings and audience at key-mint time and
    resolve grant presets.

### Patch Changes

- 6474f42: Exempt the `/v1/admin/mcp` surface from the coarse `require-actor` method+path
  permission guard (alongside `_meta`). The in-deployment MCP server authorizes at a
  finer grain — each tool is gated by its own `requiredScopes` — so any authenticated
  API key or staff session reaches the endpoint and simply sees a scope-filtered tool
  list. This lets external MCP clients authenticate with a Bearer scoped key
  (voyant#2801) without needing a wildcard grant.
- 5786f63: Mount eager module and extension routes before lazy wildcard route stubs so concrete booking extensions, including MICE booking details, are reachable under shared admin surfaces.

## 0.120.1

### Patch Changes

- ffe7787: Fix a latent duplicate-operationId hole in `stampModuleMetadata`.

  Declared operationIds were only added to the uniqueness set as the path loop
  reached them, so a route hand-authoring an operationId that matched a string an
  _earlier_ path had already derived would leave two operations sharing that id
  (breaking client generators). All route-declared ids are now pre-seeded before
  any id is derived, so derived ids always yield to declared ones. No generated
  spec changes today (no route declares an operationId yet) — this hardens the
  non-destructive override path.

- 13148ad: Add `servers`, `operationId`, and `summary` to generated OpenAPI specs (#2729).

  Completes the metadata Redocly/Swagger tooling expects:

  - **`servers`** — a relative `[{ url: "/" }]` entry so "try it out" targets the
    origin the deployment serves the contract from (overridable per deployment).
  - **`operationId`** — a stable camelCase id derived from method + path
    (`GET /v1/admin/bookings/{id}` → `getAdminBookingsById`), unique per document,
    so generated clients get readable, deterministic method names.
  - **`summary`** — the method + path signature on every operation, so viewers
    and linters have a title for each.

  All three are stamped by `stampModuleMetadata` and are non-destructive — a value
  a route already declares (e.g. a hand-authored `summary`) is never overwritten.

## 0.120.0

### Minor Changes

- 1cb9cba: Stamp `x-voyant-module` and `x-voyant-surface` on every OpenAPI operation.

  Follow-up to the per-module spec split (voyant#2733) and a step toward
  voyant#2729. Each operation in the generated specs (aggregate + per-module) now
  carries `x-voyant-module` and `x-voyant-surface` extensions, so the specs are
  self-describing — a module-grouped docs UI or a client generator can read the
  owning module and surface off each operation instead of re-deriving them from
  path prefixes. The module is the authoritative owner from the mount manifest, so
  `publicPath` routes are labelled with their real owning module (e.g.
  `/v1/public/payment-policy/resolve` → `x-voyant-module: bookings`) rather than
  their mount prefix.

  `@voyant-travel/hono/openapi` exposes the underlying pieces:
  `buildModulePathOwnership` (path → module map), `partitionByModule`
  (synchronous split from a precomputed map), and `stampModuleMetadata`.
  `splitDocumentByModule` is retained as a convenience wrapper.

### Patch Changes

- 131ff9b: Tag every OpenAPI operation with its module for Swagger/Scalar grouping.

  `stampModuleMetadata` now also sets `tags: [module]` on each operation (unless
  the route already declares tags). Swagger UI, Scalar, and Redoc key their
  sidebar grouping off `tags` and ignore `x-*` extensions, so without this a
  whole-surface document (`framework-admin.json`) collapses under a single
  "default" group — the browsability pain in voyant#2733. With it, any deployment
  can point a viewer straight at a generated spec and get a module-grouped
  explorer with no extra work.

  - @voyant-travel/workflows@0.111.14

## 0.119.0

### Minor Changes

- 86fbb05: Generate OpenAPI specs per module instead of committing one giant aggregate.

  `@voyant-travel/hono/openapi` gains `generateModuleOpenApiDocuments` (one
  self-contained document per module, built directly from the routes that module
  registered) and `splitDocumentByModule` (partitions a composed document so every
  admin/storefront path lands in exactly one module document — the module manifest
  is the authoritative owner, with the path's own segment as the fallback for
  routes no module claims, e.g. `additionalRoutes` mounts). The composed app now
  records an `app.moduleMounts` manifest (mirroring `app.lazyMounts`) so the
  generator knows each module's real mount prefix, including `publicPath` overrides
  whose prefix isn't the module name (e.g. `/v1/public/booking-engine`).

  `@voyant-travel/openapi` now ships compact, browsable per-module specs under
  `spec/{admin,storefront}/<module>.json`, exposed via new `./admin/*` and
  `./storefront/*` subpath exports (e.g.
  `import bookings from "@voyant-travel/openapi/admin/bookings"`). The
  multi-megabyte aggregate specs (`framework-openapi.json` / `-admin` /
  `-storefront`) are no longer committed to git — GitHub can't render a 7 MB file
  and any route change rewrote the whole thing — but they're still published in
  the npm tarball (generated at `prepack`) and produced locally by `build`, so the
  `.` / `./admin` / `./storefront` exports keep resolving.

### Patch Changes

## 0.118.4

### Patch Changes

- 88edbe6: Keep durable event outbox rows tied to subscriber delivery when request schedulers fail after capture.
- Updated dependencies [88edbe6]
  - @voyant-travel/core@0.111.1

## 0.118.3

### Patch Changes

- fd17317: Honor the `search` action for API-key/staff scopes on `POST /v1/<surface>/*/search` routes. Search endpoints are exposed as POST (complex bodies) but are read-family operations, so a token scoped `catalog:search`/`catalog:read` was previously rejected with 403 on `POST /v1/admin/catalog/search`. Non-search POST routes (product writes, bookings, pricing, …) stay gated on their normal write actions.

## 0.118.2

### Patch Changes

- 24413e3: Use a live operation-scoped database client for request outbox settlement so deferred subscriber completion or failure bookkeeping does not reuse a disposed request pool.

## 0.118.1

### Patch Changes

- 154a6c2: Add an authenticated R2 document download resolver helper for private Worker-route downloads.

## 0.118.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a1197b: Move the operator media upload and serve routes off the bare `/v1/*` surface and onto `/v1/admin/*`.

  Uploads now post to `/v1/admin/uploads` and video tickets to `/v1/admin/uploads/video`; stored media is served from `/v1/admin/media/*`. The Hono app no longer mounts the bare `/v1/*` catch-all actor guard, and worker-runtime hosts can use `rewriteAppPath` to preserve compatibility for persisted legacy media URLs.

  - @voyant-travel/workflows@0.111.10

## 0.117.2

### Patch Changes

- d61803e: Require `Content-Type: application/json` for `.openapi()` JSON bodies (voyant#2114).

  Hono's `json` validator supplies `{}` to the schema (instead of parsing) when a
  request sends a body but omits — or mis-declares — the `application/json`
  content-type. For schemas with required fields `{}` fails validation and yields
  a clean 400, but for `.partial()` PATCH update schemas `{}` _validates_: the
  handler then runs with an empty patch and silently no-ops (200), dropping the
  caller's changes. This affected every migrated PATCH route with a partial body
  schema.

  `openApiValidationHook` now enforces the content-type the route's contract
  declares for the `json` validation target, so a missing or non-json header is a
  clean `invalid_request` 400 rather than a silent no-op. The regex accepts
  `application/json`, `application/json; charset=utf-8`, and `application/vnd.x+json`;
  only the `json` target is gated, so `query`/`param`/`header`/`form` (including
  multipart uploads) are untouched. The fix is one place in the shared hook and
  completes §16's content-type policy for all already-merged routes; no route or
  spec changes required.

- adf0f72: Make the app-wide `requestBodyLimit` cap content-type-aware (voyant#2114).

  A prior fix raised the global ceiling to `MAX_GLOBAL_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` (26 MiB)
  so chunked media uploads (25 MiB file + multipart envelope) aren't rejected. That
  also loosened migrated `.openapi()` JSON routes from the old `parseJsonBody` 10 MiB
  cap up to 26 MiB.

  `requestBodyLimit` now accepts an optional `jsonMaxBytes` and applies it (via a
  case-sensitive `application/json` content-type match mirroring Hono's `jsonRegex`)
  to JSON bodies, while non-JSON bodies (uploads) keep the outer `maxBytes` ceiling.
  `createApp` wires `jsonMaxBytes` to `DEFAULT_REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` (10 MiB) and
  `maxBytes` to `MAX_GLOBAL_REQUEST_BODY_BYTES` (26 MiB), restoring the 10 MiB JSON
  cap for every migrated route while keeping uploads at 26 MiB. The 413 response
  shape and GET/HEAD/OPTIONS skip are unchanged; both exports are unchanged.

- 99233e6: Enforce the request body-size cap on the actual stream, not just `Content-Length` (voyant#2114).

  The framework-level `requestBodyLimit` middleware previously only checked the
  `Content-Length` header. The old `parseJsonBody` path additionally read the body
  through a bounded reader, so it rejected oversized bodies even when no
  `Content-Length` was present (chunked / HTTP/2). Routes migrated to `.openapi()`
  read via Hono's `json` validator (`c.req.json()`), which bypasses `parseJsonBody`,
  so a chunked / no-`Content-Length` oversized body was parsed unbounded — affecting
  every migrated JSON-body route (public + admin).

  `requestBodyLimit` now wraps Hono's built-in `bodyLimit`, which checks
  `Content-Length` AND wraps the body stream to abort once the read exceeds the cap.
  The existing 413 response shape is preserved via `bodyLimit`'s `onError`
  (`{ error, code: "request_body_too_large", maxBytes }`), GET/HEAD/OPTIONS are still
  skipped, and `DEFAULT_REQUEST_BODY_LIMIT_BYTES` / `RequestBodyLimitOptions` are
  unchanged. One-place fix that restores the bound for all migrated routes.

## 0.117.1

### Patch Changes

- cda876b: Map Hono's `HTTPException` onto the framework error contract (voyant#2114).

  `.openapi()` routes with a JSON body install Hono's request validator, which
  throws `HTTPException(400, "Malformed JSON in request body")` for malformed
  client JSON _before_ `openApiValidationHook` runs. The shared
  `normalizeValidationError` previously only recognized `ApiHttpError` and
  `ZodError`, so `handleApiError` fell through to a bare 500 for bad client input
  on every migrated `.openapi()` JSON-body route.

  `normalizeValidationError` now recognizes `HTTPException` and maps it onto the
  framework contract — a 400 becomes a structured `{ code: "invalid_request" }`
  4xx, restoring the clean 400 that `parseJsonBody` produced pre-migration. The
  fix is one place in the error boundary and benefits all already-migrated routes;
  no route or spec changes required.

## 0.117.0

### Minor Changes

- 7c5ee80: Modules can own their OpenAPI contract (voyant#2114).

  The composed app root is now an `OpenAPIHono`, so routes authored with
  `@hono/zod-openapi`'s `createRoute(...).openapi(...)` contribute to a generated
  OpenAPI document at their real composed path. A new
  `@voyant-travel/hono/openapi` entrypoint exposes `generateOpenApiDocument` +
  `selectSurface` for build-time generation (kept off the package barrel so the
  doc generator stays out of the Worker runtime bundle). Existing plain routes are
  unaffected.

  The `commerce` markets list route is the first to declare its contract this way,
  using `listResponseSchema(...)` from `@voyant-travel/types` for its response
  envelope.

### Patch Changes

- @voyant-travel/workflows@0.111.9

## 0.116.2

### Patch Changes

- 12a1eb2: Expose client-safe subpaths for validation schemas, linkable metadata, template authoring metadata, finance payment-policy primitives, and Hono reporter utilities. Move browser-facing React/operator imports off mixed runtime barrels so client bundles do not pull Hono request context or other server-only runtime code.

## 0.116.1

### Patch Changes

- 293e5e4: Make Hono public path matching base-path aware for path-prefixed deployments.
  - @voyant-travel/db@0.109.2

## 0.116.0

### Minor Changes

- 684b321: Bundle-level anonymous-access declarations (ADR-0008). `HonoBundle` gains an `anonymous?: string[]` field for **absolute** API paths a plugin exposes that are reachable without a session — for routes that mount outside the `/v1/public/{name}` convention, like a payment-processor webhook. `expandHonoBundles` collects these into `ExpandedHonoBundles.anonymousPaths`, and `createApp` folds them into the assembled anonymous allow-list alongside module/extension `anonymous` declarations and explicit `publicPaths`.

  `netopiaHonoBundle` now declares its callback (`/v1/finance/providers/netopia/callback`) anonymous, so deployments no longer carry it in `publicPaths` — the "reachable-without-auth" decision lives with the plugin that owns the route.

  Additive and non-breaking: a bundle that declares no `anonymous` contributes nothing to the allow-list.

- 2542715: Transactional-path declarations (ADR-0008 Phase 2). `HonoModule`/`HonoExtension` gain `transactionalPaths?: string[]` — absolute API path prefixes that must be served by the transaction-capable db client, for routes mounted outside the name-based surface where only a _subset_ transacts (e.g. a lazy family at `/v1/admin/catalog/quote`). `mountApp` folds these into the transactional-prefix map alongside the existing name-based `requiresTransactionalDb`, so a deployment no longer hand-maintains `dbTransactionalPaths`.

  The standard families now declare their own transactional surface: `@voyant-travel/trips` is name-based `requiresTransactionalDb` (every trips route reserves), and the catalog booking engine (`operator/catalog-booking`) declares its `quote`/`book`/`holds`/`orders` prefixes via `transactionalPaths` (search/draft/snapshot reads stay on the cheap default client). The operator starter's `dbTransactionalPaths` list is removed entirely.

  Additive and non-breaking: `dbTransactionalPaths` is still honored as an escape hatch; a module that declares neither flag is unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- @voyant-travel/workflows@0.111.6

## 0.115.0

### Minor Changes

- 04b257c: Anonymous-access declarations (ADR-0008 Phase 1). A module/extension can now declare which of its PUBLIC routes are reachable without a session via an `anonymous?: boolean | string[]` field on `HonoModule`/`HonoExtension` — `true` opens the whole public mount, a string array opens specific sub-paths relative to it. `createApp` assembles the global anonymous allow-list from these declarations (unioned with any explicit `publicPaths`, now an escape hatch) and feeds it to both the auth middleware and the public-write rate-limit matcher, so the "reachable-without-auth" decision lives next to the route instead of in a hand-maintained list. New pure helper `assembleAnonymousPaths(modules, extensions, explicit)` is exported for tooling/audit.

  The standard framework families that own anonymous routes now declare it (catalog, bookings, finance payment/collections/accountant sub-paths, legal, public-document-delivery, storefront verification + intake, customer-portal contact-exists, proposals); the framework's `anonymous-surface` test asserts the full assembled standard surface as an auditable snapshot.

  Additive and non-breaking: a deployment that declares no `anonymous` and passes `publicPaths` explicitly gets identical behavior.

- 78c15fa: Module subsetting, Phase 1 (ADR-0007). The standard set is default-on; `createVoyantApp` now accepts `exclude` — a list of standard module/extension specifiers to REMOVE from the framework set, for a deployment that doesn't run them (e.g. `@voyant-travel/flights`).

  Excludes are validated against the new `FRAMEWORK_CAPABILITY_GRAPH` (declaring `provides`/`requires`/`isRequired`): excluding a module another mounted module depends on, an `isRequired` foundational module, or a specifier not in the standard set throws a named boot error listing what's wrong — never a runtime 500. Adds the pure validators `findCapabilityGaps` (`@voyant-travel/hono/composition`) and `subsetStandardManifest` (`@voyant-travel/framework`).

  Additive and non-breaking: omitting `exclude` mounts the full standard set exactly as before.

  Capability _replacement_ (swap Voyant CRM for HubSpot via override-by-capability + injected ports) is the documented v2 design and intentionally not wired yet — the `PeopleDirectory` port doesn't exist, so a replace knob would silently mis-resolve. Removal works today; replacement, schema-side subsetting, and the port extraction are tracked follow-ups.

## 0.113.0

### Minor Changes

- 021ec00: Add vendor-neutral observability primitives (RFC voyant#1553).

  - **Request-id async context** — the `requestId` middleware now stores the correlation id on the `requestId` context variable and runs the request inside an `AsyncLocalStorage`, so any downstream code (services, subscribers, reporters) can read it via the new `getRequestId()` export — no header threading or `Context` access required. Error responses now also carry the `X-Request-Id` header. New exports: `getRequestId`, `runWithRequestId` (from the package root and `@voyant-travel/hono/observability`).
  - **Pluggable error `Reporter`** — `VoyantAppConfig` gains `reporter` and `appName`. Unhandled 5xx exceptions at the `fetch` catch point emit a normalized `{ requestId, app, error, context }` event to the configured `Reporter`, where `requestId` is the same id surfaced to the user. The default is a no-op (zero vendor coupling); a built-in `consoleReporter` is provided, and Sentry/OpenTelemetry backends can be wired as opt-in adapters implementing the exported `Reporter` interface. Capture is best-effort — it never throws and async reporters are flushed via `waitUntil`. New exports: `Reporter`, `ErrorEvent`, `noopReporter`, `consoleReporter`, `safeCaptureException`.
  - **Standard catch points beyond HTTP** — the reporter is now also wired into the non-request runtime catch points the RFC named, so background/async faults aren't an observability blind spot: app **bootstrap** (module/plugin/extension `bootstrap` failures), the **workflow forwarder** (EventBus→driver ingest), and **EventBus subscriber dispatch** errors. `@voyant-travel/core`'s `createEventBus` gains an optional `onSubscriberError(event, error)` hook (the bus stays vendor-neutral; the framework routes it to the reporter). Intentional fail-open paths (cache, metrics, rate-limit, workflow compensation) stay silent by design.

  The framework owns the id, the catch points, and the event shape; the backend stays a deployment choice. Deployments that don't set `reporter` keep the no-op default — the only behavioral change is the new runtime prerequisite below.

  **Runtime requirement (Cloudflare Workers):** the request-id async context uses `AsyncLocalStorage` (`node:async_hooks`), which requires the `nodejs_compat` (or `nodejs_als`) compatibility flag — now on the always-used request path, not just when a `reporter` is configured. This is already standard for Voyant Worker deployments (the operator starter and templates set `nodejs_compat`); Node deployments need nothing. Add `"compatibility_flags": ["nodejs_compat"]` to `wrangler.jsonc` if your Worker doesn't already have it.

- a3bd51c: `createApp` is now the **config-driven front door**: it takes `{ manifest, registry, capabilities, ... }`, runs `composeFromManifest` internally, and mounts — so a deployment makes one call instead of `composeFromManifest(...)` + the old `createApp({ modules, extensions })`.

  **Breaking:** the previous low-level `createApp({ modules, extensions, ... })` is renamed to **`mountApp`** (same signature). Callers that pass already-resolved `modules`/`extensions` (tests, advanced hosts) should import `mountApp`; callers that compose from a manifest should use the new `createApp`.

### Patch Changes

- d222e9f: **Convergence (Workstream B step 3):** `@voyant-travel/framework` now exports `createVoyantApp({ providers, modules?, extensions?, …config })` — the config-driven front door. It assembles the framework-owned standard set (`FRAMEWORK_RUNTIME_MANIFEST` + `frameworkComposition`) with the deployment's injected providers and any deployment-local module/extension additions, then delegates to `@voyant-travel/hono`'s lower-level `createApp`.

  A standard deployment's `app.ts` collapses to a single `createVoyantApp({ providers: buildOperatorProviders(), modules: deploymentLocalModules, …db/workflows/outbox/publicPaths })` call — no hand-maintained manifest or registry. The operator starter is converged: `buildOperatorCapabilities → buildOperatorProviders`, the two deployment-local module factories are extracted to `deploymentLocalModules`, and `OPERATOR_RUNTIME_MANIFEST` / `operatorComposition` remain only as derived exports for `voyant db doctor` parity + the composition tests.

  (hono: docstring on `createApp` updated to point standard deployments at `createVoyantApp`.)

## 0.111.0

### Minor Changes

- 9ea7220: Add first-class, context-preserving lazy route contributions. `HonoModule` and
  `HonoExtension` now accept `lazyAdminRoutes` / `lazyPublicRoutes` loaders
  (`() => Promise<Hono>`); `createApp` mounts them at the surface prefix,
  dynamically imports the bundle on first matching request, and caches it per
  isolate. Unlike a raw `subApp.fetch(...)` forward, the dispatcher bridges the
  request context (`c.var` — db, container, actor, …) into the loaded sub-app, so
  lazy routes behave identically to eager ones.

  Also adds `lazyRoutes?: { paths, load }` for deployment-local families that span
  multiple absolute path prefixes (the context-preserving replacement for ad-hoc
  `mountLazyRouteApp` forwards). New exports: `mountLazyRoutesAt`,
  `mountLazyRoutePaths`, `createLazyRouteHandler`, `LazyRoutesLoader`,
  `LazyHonoRoutes`.

### Patch Changes

- 0c003f3: Make workflows node-only and remove the stale Cloudflare edge/Node step split.

  Workflow runtime annotations now accept only `runtime: "node"`, legacy
  `runtime: "edge"` is rejected, and the old split-runner wiring has been removed.
  The legacy Cloudflare workflow adapter packages, Worker reference apps, and
  standalone external step-server artifact have been removed. Managed Cloud apps
  should forward workflow calls to the hosted Node runtime, and self-hosted
  deployments should use the Node/Postgres runtime package.

  preserving the existing package route prefixes during the v1 migration.

  Allow manifest module factories in `@voyant-travel/hono/composition` to expand to
  multiple Hono modules. Remove the Promotions package's direct Storefront
  dependency by keeping the storefront offer resolver structurally typed.

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- b0f1e21: Per-request metrics middleware (RFC #1687 Phase 3.4, the in-worker half). `createApp` mounts it by default; it is inert without an `env.METRICS` Analytics Engine binding (`metrics: false` disables). One data point per request: blobs `[method, routePattern, surface, cacheStatus]`, doubles `[durationMs, status, dbQueryCount]`, index `routePattern` — complementing the platform dispatcher's per-dispatch dataset with what only the worker can see (matched route, db query count via a counting view the db middleware exposes, in-worker cache hits). The operator template declares the binding (`voyant_operator_metrics`; namespaced per tenant by the Voyant Cloud publisher).

## 0.108.0

### Minor Changes

- b7056f1: `createApp({ outbox: true })` makes request emits durable: envelopes persist to the `event_outbox` table (via the per-request db client) before any subscriber runs; failed deliveries are retried by `drainOutbox` (run it from a cron — see the operator template's `*/2min` drain). If the durable capture itself fails (DB unreachable), the emit falls back to direct delivery with an error log rather than failing the request. The augmented app now exposes `app.eventBus` so scheduled handlers can drain through the same subscriber set.

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- 7255353: Split data plane + auth caching (Phase 1 of the enterprise-scale plan, RFC #1687):

  - **Per-surface db routing.** `createApp` accepts `dbTransactional` (and `dbTransactionalPaths`): when provided, requests are routed by path — surfaces of modules/extensions declaring `requiresTransactionalDb` get the transactional (WebSocket) factory, everything else gets the cheap default (typically neon-http: one fetch per query, zero connection handshake). The auth/permission/db middlewares accept the new `DbSource` (factory or selector) and keep sharing one client per request. The transaction-capability assertion becomes per-surface: the default client is allowed to be transaction-incapable. `createPathDbSelector` is exported for custom wiring. Without `dbTransactional`, behavior is unchanged.
  - **API-key KV cache.** `voy_` API-key validation caches the key row in the `env.CACHE` KV binding (60s TTL) for quota-less keys, eliminating the per-request Postgres SELECT for steady-state server-to-server traffic. Quota-limited keys always read fresh. Trade-off: revoking/disabling a cached key takes up to 60s. Usage counters now update via SQL increments (no stale arithmetic under concurrency).

## 0.106.0

### Minor Changes

- 418fa82: Request-path performance pass (Phase 0 of the enterprise-scale plan, RFC #1687):

  - **Single shared per-request db client.** `requireAuth`, `requirePermission`, and the `db` middleware now resolve one client per request via an internal lease (`acquireRequestDb`) instead of each constructing its own — an authenticated request previously opened 2–3 Neon WebSocket Pools (each a full TLS+auth handshake); it now opens exactly one. The creating middleware owns the single dispose, scheduled via `waitUntil` after the response.
  - **`publicResponseCache` middleware** (mounted by `createApp` by default; disable/tune via the new `publicCache` config). Caches `GET /v1/public/*` responses that a route explicitly marks `Cache-Control: public, s-maxage=…` (and that carry no `Set-Cookie`). Cache hits are served before auth, the db client, and the runtime bootstrap — a hit costs no Postgres connection and no module-graph instantiation. Uses the Cache API where available and falls back to the `env.CACHE` KV binding (Workers-for-Platforms namespaced scripts have no `caches.default`); transparent no-op when neither exists.
  - **Event emits no longer block responses.** Inside a request, `createApp` exposes a request-scoped EventBus whose emits defer non-`inline` subscribers past the response via `executionCtx.waitUntil` — booking confirmations stop waiting on third-party subscriber HTTP calls (CMS sync, e-invoicing). Subscribers that need read-your-writes visibility within the request opt in with `inline: true` on the plugin subscriber.
  - **CORS allowlist memoized** per `CORS_ALLOWLIST` value (was re-split + wildcard-RegExp-recompiled on every request).
  - **Guarded `executionCtx` access** in auth/permission middlewares — Hono throws on `executionCtx` outside Workers; auth integrations now receive `ctx: undefined` on such runtimes instead of the request 500ing.

### Minor Changes

- 656b25d: Add `@voyant-travel/hono/composition` — manifest-driven runtime composition. `composeFromManifest(manifest, registry, capabilities)` derives a template's `createApp({ modules, extensions })` arrays from a registry keyed by manifest specifier, with factories receiving a typed capability container (the deployment's storage/FX/providers/document-download resolvers gathered in one place). `diffManifestRegistry` reports manifest↔registry drift for tooling. Lets a template stop hand-listing modules/extensions; the operator template now composes from its manifest. See voyant#1608 / #1620.

## 0.99.0

### Minor Changes

- b7dde79: Add the admin capability-discovery route — `GET /v1/admin/_meta/capabilities`.

  `createApp` now serves a built-in capabilities route (under the `/v1/admin/*`
  staff guard) when the deployment supplies the operation catalogue via the new
  `adminMeta` config: `{ contractVersion, deploymentVersion?, operations }`. It
  returns the enabled modules, the operation catalogue, the contract/deployment
  version, and the caller's resolved actor + scopes — so the admin SDK's
  `client.capabilities()` returns live data.

  `adminMeta` is typed structurally, so `@voyant-travel/hono` stays decoupled from
  `@voyant-travel/admin-contracts`; deployments inject the catalogue from
  `admin-contracts`' `ADMIN_CONTRACT_VERSION` + `operationCapabilities()`. When
  `adminMeta` is omitted, the route is not mounted. Wired in `templates/dmc` as the
  reference. (#1411 roadmap item 1.)

## 0.64.0

### Minor Changes

- 6d0c8f3: Extract `withOptionalTransaction` into `@voyant-travel/db/transaction` so the soft-fallback helper that action-ledger has used since 0.62.0 can be shared by any package that needs it. Add `Module.requiresTransactionalDb` so modules whose write paths use interactive transactions declare it, and have `createApp()` assert on first request that the resolved db adapter supports `db.transaction(async (tx) => …)`. With the neon-http (edge) adapter that assertion now throws an actionable error pointing at `createServerlessDbClient` (neon-serverless / WebSocket) or `createDbClient(url, { adapter: "node" })` — instead of the cryptic "No transactions support in neon-http driver" exception thrown on first write.

### Minor Changes

- 6ea6ded: Harden public checkout sessions with scoped signed capabilities.

Public mutable checkout/payment routes also accept the shared `Idempotency-Key` retry middleware where it was missing.

### Minor Changes

- db51715: Closes #500: switch both templates' Workers DB layer from Hyperdrive to the Neon serverless WebSocket driver. Drops the \`HYPERDRIVE\` binding from \`wrangler.jsonc\` + \`env.d.ts\` in both \`templates/dmc\` and \`templates/operator\`; templates now connect directly via \`@neondatabase/serverless\` Pool + \`drizzle-orm/neon-serverless\` using the same \`DATABASE_URL\` secret.

  Two helpers ship in each template's \`src/api/lib/db.ts\`:

  - \`getDbFromEnv(env, executionCtx?)\` — returns a per-request \`NeonDatabase\`. When \`executionCtx\` is passed, schedules \`pool.end()\` via \`waitUntil\` so the WebSocket closes promptly. When omitted, the Pool is left for the Workers runtime to reclaim on isolate teardown.
  - \`withDbFromEnv(env, fn)\` — higher-order helper for non-Hono code paths (event subscribers, scheduled handlers, retry workers). Owns the Pool lifecycle inline (open → \`fn\` → \`finally pool.end()\`).

  Touched packages get a minor bump because the shared types broaden:

  - \`@voyant-travel/db\` — \`AnyDrizzleDb\` union now includes \`NeonDatabase\` from \`drizzle-orm/neon-serverless\` alongside the existing \`PostgresJsDatabase\` and \`NeonHttpDatabase\` flavors.
  - \`@voyant-travel/hono\` — \`VoyantDb\` (the type Hono ctx variables expose under \`c.var.db\`) widens the same way.

  Why WebSocket and not HTTP: the bookings package and other internal services use \`db.transaction(...)\` for read-then-write logic that needs real Postgres transaction semantics. Neon's HTTP transport only batches statements (atomic but no isolation); WebSocket gives full transaction support on Workers.

  Subscribers in \`catalog-bridge\`, \`booking-schedule\`, \`smartbill\`, \`catalog-checkout\` were converted to \`withDbFromEnv\` so the Pool is owned by each subscriber call. \`getBetterAuth\` and other helpers that were hard to thread \`executionCtx\` through still call \`getDbFromEnv(env)\` without it — the Pool lingers until isolate teardown there. Tracked as a follow-up audit in #510.

  No schema migration. No behavior change for existing API contracts. Operators upgrading need to: drop the \`HYPERDRIVE\` binding from their \`wrangler.jsonc\` (if they had one), and ensure their \`DATABASE_URL\` points at a Neon Postgres reachable over WebSocket (the standard Neon connection string).

### Minor Changes

- 714c544: Make `actor` required on `VoyantRequestAuthContext` and surface a better 401 when it's missing (fixes #381).

  `requireActor` is fail-closed — when `c.var.actor` is unset, every protected request 401s. Previously the type kept `actor` optional, the API-key branch hard-coded `"staff"`, the public-paths branch hard-coded `"customer"`, but the custom `auth.resolve` branch had no enforcement, no default, and a 401 message that read like a session bug. Consumers upgrading with a working session resolver saw every `/v1/admin/*` route 401 after a valid sign-in.

  **Type-level enforcement (BREAKING for custom resolvers):**

  ```ts
  // Before
  export type VoyantRequestAuthContext = VoyantAuthContext & {
    userId: string;
  };

  // After
  export type VoyantRequestAuthContext = Omit<VoyantAuthContext, "actor"> & {
    userId: string;
    actor: Actor;
  };
  ```

  Any `auth.resolve` integration whose return type is `VoyantRequestAuthContext` now fails to compile until it includes `actor`. For single-tenant admin apps, return `actor: "staff"`. Customer/partner/supplier sessions should return the corresponding actor so `/v1/public/*` route guards keep working.

  `requirePermission` now also throws if `actor` is missing on the request context (it should be set by `requireActor` upstream); this surfaces auth-pipeline misordering rather than fabricating a default.

  **Better 401 message:**

  ```
  Unauthorized: actor not resolved. The auth pipeline did not assign an `actor`
  to this request. If you set `auth.resolve` on `createApp({...})`, the returned
  object must include `actor` (usually `"staff"` for admin sessions). Public
  routes should be listed in `publicPaths`.
  ```

  **Migration:** add `actor: "staff"` (or the appropriate actor) to whatever your `auth.resolve` returns. The DMC and operator templates and the dev app have all been updated.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 29a581a: Add `Idempotency-Key` header protocol for non-idempotent booking-creation endpoints.

  Same key + same body replays the original response; same key + different body returns `409 Conflict`. Records expire after 24h. Wired (with `required: false` default) into:

  - `POST /v1/admin/bookings/`
  - `POST /v1/admin/bookings/reserve`
  - `POST /v1/admin/bookings/from-product`
  - `POST /v1/admin/bookings/from-offer/:offerId/reserve`
  - `POST /v1/admin/bookings/from-order/:orderId/reserve`
  - `POST /v1/public/bookings/sessions`
  - `POST /v1/public/bookings/sessions/:sessionId/confirm`

  Ships:

  - `idempotency_keys` table in `@voyant-travel/db/schema/infra` keyed by `(scope, key)`, with body-hash, captured response, and TTL.
  - `idempotencyKey({ scope, required? })` middleware in `@voyant-travel/hono` that reads the header, replays/conflicts/expires, and captures `2xx` JSON responses. Echoes `Idempotency-Key` + `Idempotency-Replayed: true` on replay.
  - `purgeExpiredIdempotencyKeys()` helper for daily-cron cleanup.

  Backwards-compatible: clients without the header continue to work. Templates can flip a route to `required: true` per endpoint once their client has rolled out.

- b7f0501: **BREAKING:** `requireActor` middleware now returns `401 Unauthorized` when no actor is set on the request, instead of defaulting to `"staff"`.

  Earlier versions silently granted operator privileges to anonymous traffic if `requireAuth` was missing, misordered, or a route mounted before auth. The fail-open default has been replaced with fail-closed.

  **Migration:**

  - `requireAuth` now sets `actor: "staff"` explicitly on the core-owned API key path (`voy_` prefix), so server-to-server integrations behave the same.
  - Custom `auth.resolve` integrations that previously relied on the implicit `"staff"` fallback must now return an explicit `actor` from `resolve()`.
  - Anonymous requests on `/v1/admin/*` now return `401` instead of `200`. Anonymous requests on `/v1/public/*` continue to receive `actor: "customer"` via the `publicPaths` bypass when applicable, and `401` otherwise.
  - The differentiation between `401` (no actor) and `403` (actor not in the allowed list) is now reliable — earlier the no-actor path returned `403` for some surfaces and `200` for others.
