## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- f7c68ae: Republish through the workspace release flow: 0.2.0 was published with raw `catalog:` and `workspace:^` specifiers in its manifest, which npm cannot resolve — any consumer install (including the release tarball verification) fails with EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 52352c4: Move custom-field definition Settings ownership to the generic custom-fields
  package. Selected entity manifests now declare the targets and field types that
  the canonical API may accept. The unused Relationships definition API and
  Settings surfaces are removed without compatibility adapters.

  Target capability declarations now constrain searchable, exportable, and
  invoiceable settings end to end, and unsupported flags are stored as false.

- 52352c4: Store custom-field values exclusively as `custom_fields[namespace][key]`.
  Owner-scoped value operations derive namespaces from trusted definition
  context, ordinary entity routes preserve non-operator namespaces, and
  definition rename/delete cleanup is delegated to the package that owns each
  entity table.
- 52352c4: Persist custom-field namespace, owner, lifecycle, and provenance metadata.
  Operator definitions use the reserved `custom` namespace, app operations are
  owner-constrained, platform definitions derive ownership from the selected
  target, and Settings renders non-operator definitions as read-only.
- 52352c4: Remove project-local TypeScript custom-field declarations, discovery globs,
  executable validation callbacks, and code/database merge helpers. The generic
  custom-fields package now owns canonical value routes and dispatches operations
  to selected entity-owning packages through typed runtime contributions, with no
  Relationships compatibility adapter.
