# @voyant-travel/i18n

## 0.111.0

### Minor Changes

- bbe6396: Replace the overloaded Finance voucher domain with Travel Credits across the
  database schema, APIs, package exports, booking inputs, storefront settings,
  and operator UI. Redemption commands are replay-safe, codes are normalized and
  case-insensitively unique, and legacy records migrate in place without silently
  skipping invalid balances. Keep Promotion Codes in Commerce and move Bookings
  fulfillment to the explicit Service Voucher vocabulary.

## 0.110.0

### Minor Changes

- 62e87ee: Surface flight orders (bookings/tickets). Adds a Flights → Orders list page (`FlightOrdersPage`) and an order detail route on the packaged flights admin, so a held order — carrying a ticketing deadline — no longer disappears after the confirmation screen. Operators can review orders, filter by status/search, and from the detail view issue tickets (before the deadline) or cancel. Adds a `useFlightOrderTicket` hook and a capability-gated `POST /orders/:orderId/ticket` route to the flights module. The operator admin sidebar now expands Flights into **Search** and **Orders** sub-items (`admin` nav + `i18n` `flightsSearch` label; `flightOrders` label already existed).

## 0.109.8

### Patch Changes

- f1090b7: Align resource assignment detail schemas around `assignedAt`, reject orphan or incoherent slot assignment lifecycle payloads, and surface assignment target validation in the admin UI.
- 42f662c: Reject inverted, duplicate, and overlapping resource closeout windows and surface matching admin form validation.

## 0.109.7

### Patch Changes

- bd00f36: Improve booking Documents tab guidance by disabling traveler document submission until a file upload exists, clearing upload form state when the selected file is removed, aligning empty-state copy with the Add contract action, and explaining unavailable generated-contract preview setup.

## 0.109.6

### Patch Changes

- 14845ee: Rename the operator Channel sync surface to Distribution and clarify setup, monitoring, retry, reconcile, and delivery messaging.

## 0.109.5

### Patch Changes

- ad02eae: Reject non-image product media as cover media and surface brochure generation failures in the product detail UI.

## 0.109.4

### Patch Changes

- 16ec0cb: Render saved additional rate-plan room/category prices in the admin product detail grid and label the price controls for assistive technology.

## 0.109.3

### Patch Changes

- b1f90b0: Block trip component mutations after checkout has started and surface the locked state in the admin composer.
- c1d8f71: Return failed trip reservations as conflict responses, hide internal SQL details from reservation failures, and persist the admin draft-booking toggle before reserve.

## 0.109.2

### Patch Changes

- a96ce05: Recompute Trips reserve validation when component payment schedule mode changes and show payment schedule validation reasons before reserve.

## 0.109.1

### Patch Changes

- c6acfa5: Exclude cancelled and removed trip components from active trip aggregate totals, refresh those totals after component cancellation, and label active versus cancelled component value in the admin trip detail.

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- 7cb6fa7: Package-delivered MICE admin surface (`@voyant-travel/mice-react/admin`).

  - New `./admin` entry exporting `createMiceAdminExtension` — contributes the
    Programs nav item (spliced after Bookings) plus the route implementations for
    the programs list (`/mice`) and a program's detail (`/mice/$id`, where the
    per-currency cost sheet lives). Picked up by `voyant admin generate` via the
    `<module>-react/admin` convention; resolves the `mice.program.list` /
    `mice.program.detail` semantic destinations.
  - `@voyant-travel/i18n`: new `nav.mice` operator-admin label (en "Programs",
    ro "Programe").

## 0.108.0

### Minor Changes

- 4abf9a2: Deployment team management + granular member RBAC (voyant#2085).

  - `@voyant-travel/types`: `member-roles` (preset bundles reusing the API-key permission catalog) + `settings`/`team` resources.
  - `@voyant-travel/auth`: `cloud-broker` member-management client + assertion `scopes`.
  - `@voyant-travel/hono`: opt-in staff-session scope enforcement in `requireActor` (`VOYANT_RBAC_ENFORCE`) + `isStaffRbacEnforced`.
  - `@voyant-travel/admin`: auth-mode-aware `TeamSettingsPage` with a granular permission editor.
  - `@voyant-travel/bookings`/`legal`: PII reveal gated on `bookings-pii:read` under enforcement.
  - `@voyant-travel/db`: `user_profiles.permissions` + `cloud_auth_user_links.scopes`.

## 0.107.4

### Patch Changes

- ba89f0b: Let admin departure edits choose and persist a product option so existing departures with a missing option can be repaired from the UI. Explicit slot option links are now validated against the slot product while product-level generated slots can still omit an option.

## 0.107.3

### Patch Changes

- 310565b: Surface a missing-option warning in the departures (availability slots) list (#2062).

  The slots table now has an Option column that shows each departure's option name
  and flags — with an amber badge + tooltip — any slot that has no option on a
  product that actually has options (i.e. an unpriceable departure that should be
  repaired via the option picker). Products without options are not flagged. The
  column resolves names from one capped active-options query per visible product,
  so a missing linkage is discoverable from the list, not just inside the edit
  dialog.

## 0.107.2

### Patch Changes

- dbea53e: Add an option picker to the admin departure (availability slot) form (#2059).

  The slot create/edit dialog now lets an operator choose which of the product's
  active options a departure belongs to — populated from the product's options
  (default marked), required when the product has options, and pre-selected from
  the slot's current `optionId` on edit so an unpriceable/incorrect slot can be
  repaired through the UI. Selecting a different product clears the stale option.
  This complements the pricing-correctness fixes in #2058: a departure's price is
  derived from its option's rate plans, so a slot must point at an option.

## 0.107.1

### Patch Changes

- c64d288: Fix Romanian i18n gaps on operator admin surfaces.

  - `@voyant-travel/catalog-react`: the cruises and accommodations browse pages rendered the static English route `title` prop as their heading; they now read the localized label from `useOperatorAdminMessages().nav.*`, matching the other catalog verticals.
  - `@voyant-travel/i18n`: corrected the quotes terminology in Romanian (operator nav + CRM org-detail) from "Cotatii" to "Oferte" so it matches the quotes package, and added a `trips.list.composeTrip` label (used by the operator's "Compose trip" action on the bookings list).

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- a74471e: Quotes admin surface. A pipeline board (`/quotes`) plus a full quote workspace (`/quotes/$id`): editable deal fields, client (person and/or organization — B2C/B2B), travelers with an explicit PAX count, line items, tags, owner, the activity timeline, and the quote's versions nested inline. The quote value is derived from its line items and recomputed server-side on every change. Saving snapshots the current line items into a new proposal version that supersedes the prior one (one current version at a time); versions show a sequential number, Active/Expired status, and an editable valid-until on the active version. Adds `quotes.paxCount` plus `createdBy`/`updatedBy` audit fields (stamped from the acting user), an owner picker sourced from team members (falling back to the current user), and the `nav.quotes` operator label. The detail is a staged editor (edit freely; Save commits everything + snapshots a proposal version), with a quote description and images shown on the client proposal, and a "Send to client" action that surfaces the shareable proposal link (re-copying resolves the deployment's public proposal URL, not the admin origin). Products-based versions can be sent for review without a Trip snapshot; since acceptance reserves a frozen Trip, the public proposal exposes an `acceptable` flag and hides Accept (keeping Decline) for product-only proposals so clients never hit a guaranteed 409. All new copy is in en + ro.

## 0.106.1

### Patch Changes

- 0b10029: Split oversized shared service, UI, locale, and reference-data modules into focused internal files while preserving the existing public exports and runtime behavior.

## 0.106.0

### Minor Changes

- 7122c2a: Admin booking journey overhaul + unified new-booking + reusable catalog UI (#1625)

  - **bookings-ui**: the operator books on a single stacked, guided accordion (progressive unlock, auto-advance) instead of the wizard; storefront keeps the wizard. Travelers as add-rows + per-traveler type + CRM linking, Configure with departure-first + nested rooms + occupancy-dependency rules, price override + voucher in the side panel, single payment-link checkbox, notes/docs block, save-as-draft / confirmed-if-paid status, duplicate-departure warning, commit lands on the booking detail. Journey steps split into per-step modules. B2B billing is satisfied by a picked organization; switching the product option clears stale room selections.
  - **catalog / catalog-react / catalog-ui**: the operator catalog browse/detail UI moves into the shared `@voyant-travel/catalog-ui` + `@voyant-travel/catalog-react` packages (detail pages, browse/dynamic/scheduled, gallery, calendar, sheet, enrichment, catalog i18n) so other templates can reuse them; booking-engine commit path returns the booking id and lands on detail.
  - **catalog-contracts**: adds pax-band occupancy dependencies, the option-units configure sub-step, and the sourced stays/package rate pin (`roomTypeId` / `ratePlanId` / `board`) to the booking-engine draft + adapter contracts.
  - **products / i18n**: products booking handler forwards the slot id + breakdown currency; admin booking-journey i18n strings.

## 0.105.0

### Minor Changes

- d1ad572: Rename CRM React hooks, UI components, and registry entries from Opportunity to Quote, with Quote Version surfaces split out for proposal/version workflows.

## 0.104.2

### Patch Changes

- cfa6af8: feat(finance): accounts-payable supplier invoices, profitability & end-to-end FX

  Adds the full accounts-payable vertical for #1506:

  - **Supplier invoices (AP)**: `supplier_invoices` / `supplier_invoice_lines` /
    `supplier_cost_allocations`, the `supplierInvoicesService` (create/update/
    setLines/setAllocations/payments), attachments, and admin API routes.
  - **Cost allocation**: two-step product → departure picker, configurable cost
    categories (managed under Settings), searchable comboboxes.
  - **Profitability**: per-departure / per-product / per-traveller P&L read model
    - dashboards, cost-by-category breakdown, charts, CSV export.
  - **Accountant share portal**: scoped, revocable token links (no login) exposing
    financials + client/supplier invoices with downloadable attachments, ZIP
    download, and an en/ro language switcher.
  - **End-to-end FX**: supplier invoices and cost allocations snapshot their
    accounting-base value at the FX rate effective on the issue date; the
    profitability rollup sums those recorded snapshots (per-transaction-date
    rates) instead of re-valuing aggregates at the latest rate.

  Supporting additive exports: `availability`/`bookings`/`suppliers` schema and
  linkable exports consumed by the finance read model, and new TypeID prefixes in
  `schema-kit`.

## 0.104.1

## 0.104.0

## 0.103.0

### Minor Changes

- a02f2f3: Follow-up polish for the operator product detail, from client review:

  - **Inclusions / exclusions / terms are now editable in the product sheet — and localizable.** The whole stack already carried `inclusionsHtml`/`exclusionsHtml`/`termsHtml` (product + `product_translations` columns, validation, react schemas, services); the form just never exposed them, so clients forked their own UI. They're now three rich-text `TranslatableField`s that switch with the language switcher and persist to the base columns + per-language translation rows.
  - **Traveler-type columns are editable/removable.** Hovering an Adult / Child column header reveals edit (opens the category dialog pre-filled) and remove (deletes a product/option-owned category, or just drops its prices for a shared global one). `TravelerCategoryDialog` is now edit-capable.
  - **Extras define + price in one place.** The standalone product-level "Extra" card is removed; each booking option's pricing has a single Extras section that both defines (new reusable `ProductExtraDialog`) and prices each add-on (per the option's rate plan), with edit/delete.

## 0.102.0

### Minor Changes

- b6d0673: Redesign the operator's **Booking options & prices** for low-tech travel agents and close the inventory/allocation gaps it exposed.

  - `@voyant-travel/products-ui`: each option now renders **one adaptive table** — a rooms grid (rooms × traveler types) or a per-person seats list — derived from the product's inventory (rooms always win over booking mode). The rate-plan layer is hidden behind an **Advanced** disclosure (a single default plan is auto-managed); the default plan's matrix is no longer duplicated there. Single-option products show the table directly with no chrome. The unit form pins its type in the contextual add ("Add room" can't create a vehicle) and uses type-aware quantity/occupancy labels; the price dialog uses the design-system currency input and pricing-mode-aware quantity labels. New departures pre-fill **Capacity (pax)** from the configured inventory (overridable).
  - `@voyant-travel/products`: `createProduct` seeds a default `Standard` option so new products open straight into the pricing table; the day-translation create route now verifies the day belongs to the product.
  - `@voyant-travel/availability` + `@voyant-travel/availability-react`: departure inventory templates can be **generated from the option's rooms** and **applied to existing open departures** (new bulk endpoint + hook). The full-inventory materializer now works for product-level departures (no `optionId`), so auto-seed on publish and bulk apply create the full room set. New per-slot `materialize-templates` endpoint.
  - `@voyant-travel/allocation-ui`: a slot's **Generate resources** now materializes the full configured inventory across all kinds in one click, instead of the pax-derived single-kind path.

## 0.101.2

### Patch Changes

- 577eaf5: Add in-context translations for products and itinerary days.

  - `@voyant-travel/products`: add a `products.default_language_tag` column (the language the base name/description columns are written in) and a new `product_day_translations` table (per-language title/description/location) with CRUD service methods and routes under `/v1/products/:id/days/:dayId/translations`.
  - `@voyant-travel/products-contracts`: validation schemas for the product default language and itinerary-day translations.
  - `@voyant-travel/products-react`: `useProductDayTranslations` / `useProductDayTranslationMutation` hooks, record/response schemas, and query keys; the product record now exposes `defaultLanguageTag`.
  - `@voyant-travel/schema-kit`: `product_day_translations` TypeID prefix (`pdtr`).
  - `@voyant-travel/i18n`: operator labels for the content-language switcher, default language, itinerary-day sheet, and market-rule columns.

## 0.101.1

### Patch Changes

- f736ba5: Improve product booking configuration for room-based travel products.

  - `@voyant-travel/products-ui`: rename the product setup UI around booking options, room inventory, traveler prices, and departure room inventory; hide traveler-age controls for room inventory units; add setup guardrails so room-based products cannot mix the legacy one-option-per-room shape with the canonical single-option/multiple-room-units shape.
  - `@voyant-travel/bookings` and `@voyant-travel/bookings-react`: preserve selected room/category refs through booking creation and quote travelers against the selected room plus traveler pricing category instead of falling back to unrelated rates.
  - `@voyant-travel/bookings-ui`: let agents select both the room and the traveler pricing category for each traveler when the selected room exposes category-specific prices, enforce room occupancy in the booking flow, and keep the booking summary aligned with the selected room.
  - `@voyant-travel/availability-react`: expose the additional resource template fields needed by room inventory setup.
  - `@voyant-travel/i18n`: add Romanian product-management labels for the renamed booking option and inventory concepts.
  - `@voyant-travel/catalog-ui`: localize ship-spec labels used by the catalog detail sheet.

### Minor Changes

- 79ce168: Slot-detail / allocation / booking-sheet UX pass.

  - `AvailabilitySlotDetailPage`: status badge color-coded by tone (open=green, closed/sold-out=red), product-type badge, locale-formatted date range with timezone chip, financial KPI cards (Remaining/Initial Pax, Total, Paid + %, Outstanding + %, per-currency rollup), timeline-style Activity tab, `<dl>`-style Metadata tab, AlertDialog delete confirmation, host-driven Edit / Open Product / Create Booking actions.
  - Slot allocation grid: side-by-side Unallocated + resources layout kicks in at `lg:` instead of `xl:`; payment-status chip palette unchanged but Tailwind source paths now cover `@voyant-travel/allocation-ui` in the operator template so the colors actually render.
  - `AvailabilitySlotsTab`: optional header / `asPanel` / `hideBulkDelete` / `bulkStatusSelect` props let hosts embed the slots table outside of a Tabs shell and replace the bulk Open/Close buttons with a single "Change status" select.
  - Allocation manifest now exposes `sellAmountCents` / `paidAmountCents` per booking (and `derivePaidAmountCents` is exported from `@voyant-travel/availability`). `productOptionSchema` adds `sellCurrency` and `productType` so consumers can drive currency / badge UI off the catalog response.
  - `GET /v1/products/:id` joins `product_types` and returns `productType` alongside the product row via new `productsService.getProductByIdWithType`.
  - `BookingCreateDialog` → `BookingCreateSheet` (file + symbol + registry slug rename). Right-side wide sheet, departure picker disables when opened with a `defaultSlotId`, full-mode payment schedule defaults the due date to the departure day until the operator touches it, payment-schedule currency falls back through product → pricing → placeholder so the server's `invalid_payment_schedules` validator stops rejecting mismatched currencies, slot-allocation cache busted after create so new bookings appear without a manual refresh.
  - `BookingQuickViewSheet`: real Payer section (email/phone/language/website/address), card-per-traveler details (email/phone/language/special-requests/notes), per-traveler document list, and a collapsible "More info" that lazily calls the audit-logged reveal endpoint to surface DOB / nationality / document / dietary / accessibility / bed preference.
  - `ProductQuickViewSheet`: new component in `@voyant-travel/products-ui` mirroring the booking quick view shape — cover image, booking/capacity mode badges, full description, dates, itinerary days (with location + description), options list with status badges, tags, "View full product" footer.
  - `AsyncCombobox` now forwards `disabled` to `ComboboxInput` so disabled comboboxes are actually uneditable.
  - `DataTable` selection checkboxes use bubble-phase `stopPropagation` (wrapped in a `<div>`) instead of `onClickCapture` — fixes the "checkbox doesn't fire" bug under base-ui's checkbox event flow.
  - `useBookingCreateMutation` consumers (sheet) invalidate `availabilityQueryKeys.slots()` after create.
  - `loadProductOptionUnits` in finance booking-create now uses the exported `toRows<T>` normalizer to handle both `drizzle-orm/postgres-js` and `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` return shapes.
  - Operator template: Availability nav item moved directly under Products; slot detail route hosts the new edit dialog, booking quick view, product quick view; Tailwind `@source` scans `@voyant-travel/allocation-ui` dist + src.
  - I18n: en/ro keys added for `tabSlots: "List"` rename, slot detail Activity timeline filters, slot Meta block, "Change status", "Create booking", "Edit slot", traveler reveal labels, booking quick view payer.

## 0.81.21

## 0.81.20

## 0.81.19

## 0.81.18

### Patch Changes

- 93874e4: Follow-ups to the booking-detail UX overhaul (#1332):

  - **Status change dialog (`@voyant-travel/bookings-ui`)**: surface the existing `suppressNotifications` API as a switch in `StatusChangeDialog`. The toggle only appears when the target status is `confirmed` (the only transition that honors the flag server-side per `status-dispatch.ts`) and routes the value through to `useBookingStatusMutation`. Lets operators confirm a booking silently — no confirmation email, no document bundle. EN/RO labels added.
  - **Booking documents tab (`templates/operator`)**: contracts table now has an "Open contract page" icon action linking to `/legal/contracts/$id`. EN/RO copy added under `bookings.detail.documentsTable.contractOpenTooltip`.
  - **Contract detail page (`@voyant-travel/legal-ui`)**: delete button now renders for `void` contracts too, not just drafts.
  - **Contract delete API (`@voyant-travel/legal`)**: `deleteContract` accepts `draft | void` (was draft-only). Returns `not_deletable` instead of `not_draft`; route error message updated to "Only draft or void contracts can be deleted".
  - **Contract auto-generation (issue #1335, `@voyant-travel/legal`)**: `issueContract` now allocates the series number **before** rendering and merges it into the render variables, so templates that print `{{ contract.number }}` / `{{ contract.contractNumber }}` resolve on the first issued PDF. The allocated number is also persisted back into `contract.variables` so regenerations stay consistent. Same merge applied in `ensureRenderedContract` for the deferred-render fallback path. New `mergeContractNumberIntoVariables` helper (exported) + 4 unit tests.

## 0.81.17

### Patch Changes

- e31a008: Follow-up to the booking-detail UX overhaul (#1332): satisfy the `i18n:check:ui-literals` CI scan.

  - `PaymentScheduleSection`: drop the unreachable `?? "Remove"` / `?? "Add installment"` fallbacks on the add / remove installment controls — the canonical `messages.paymentScheduleSection.labels` declares both keys as required, so the fallbacks were dead code that just tripped the linter.
  - `BookingInvoiceDialog`: mark the `SCHEDULE_DESCRIPTION_FALLBACK` entries (`"Deposit"`, `"Installment"`, `"Balance"`, `"Hold"`, `"Payment"`) with `i18n-literal-ok`. These persist as the invoice's line-item description and ship with the PDF — operator-managed copy intentionally English at the data layer.
  - Operator `BookingInvoiceSheet` had a literal `Download` button label on the attachment row. New nested key `bookings.detail.invoiceSheet.attachmentDownload` (`Download` / `Descarca`) threaded through as a `downloadLabel` prop so the helper stays hook-free.

## 0.81.16

### Patch Changes

- 0a617cc: Operator-dashboard booking-detail UX polish + finance refactors.

  **Booking list & detail**

  - Bookings index hides `draft` + `expired` by default; new `excludeStatuses` filter on the bookings list endpoint + react query keys.
  - Booking-detail subtitle now shows `Billing person / Product / Dates / PAX` with clickable links to the CRM person, product, and availability slot; product title truncates at 18rem with full-text tooltip.
  - Header action menu replaced by inline outline buttons (Edit / Change status / Cancel / Delete). Delete uses a proper `AlertDialog` instead of `window.confirm`.
  - Stat-card currency layout is now `<symbol> <amount> <code>` for every currency except RON (collapses to `<amount> RON`).
  - Items table dates use the active locale (`formatDateTime` from i18n provider) and show start → end when both timestamps exist.
  - Tabs reordered: Documents now precedes Suppliers.

  **Tab refactors (Items / Travelers / Payments / Invoices / Documents / Suppliers / Payment-schedule)**

  - All seven tabs migrated off `<Card>` + raw `<table>` onto the shared `<div data-slot>` + `DataTable` + `IconActionButton` + `StatusBadge` + `AlertDialog` pattern.
  - Snapshots opened in a `<Sheet>` so operators stay on the booking page.

  **Invoices tab**

  - New `BookingInvoiceDialog` (Dialog, not Sheet) for "New Invoice": Type segmented (Invoice / Proforma), Source segmented (Schedule / Custom), schedule-driven prefill that auto-derives net unit amount, tax%, due date; manual line items with add/remove; auto-derived Subtotal/Tax/Total (always read-only); SmartBill sync toggle (defaults on); Mark as paid switch with method + date pickers; attachment uploader when sync is off; sandboxed iframe contract preview.
  - Generate-from-schedule line items now back the tax out of the gross schedule amount (no more 21% inflation on top).
  - Server omits `subtotalCents/taxCents/totalCents` cross-check when client doesn't pre-compute totals.

  **Add-contract dialog (new)**

  - `BookingContractDialog` replaces the per-row "Generate contract" button. Two modes — Generate (default, preselected) renders an iframe preview via a new `?preview=true` branch on `/v1/admin/bookings/:id/generate-contract`, and Upload (title + PDF) creates a `signed`-status contract row + attaches the file.
  - Legal `autoGenerateContractForBooking` gains a `previewMode` option that stops after rendering HTML without persisting.

  **Payment schedule**

  - Switched `PaymentScheduleValue` from fixed slots to a `installments: PaymentInstallment[]` array. Mode-switch prefills due dates between today and **one day before departure** (clamps to today when lead time ≤ 1 day) and distributes amounts evenly. Add/remove redistributes amounts so the rows always sum to the booking total.
  - New Invoice column on the schedule table links to the invoice/proforma covering each row.
  - Generate-invoice / Generate-proforma actions hide when an invoice (or proforma) already covers the row, preventing accidental duplicate documents.
  - Server-side `assertBookingPaymentScheduleHasPaymentCoverage` no longer requires session-linked payments — it sums every completed payment under the booking's invoices (with FX-equivalent amounts via `baseAmountCents`) and subtracts other schedules already paid, so manually-recorded payments can mark a schedule paid.
  - Schedule edit dialog now surfaces server validation errors inline instead of swallowing them.

  **Record payment dialog**

  - "Convert proforma to invoice" switch shown when the selected invoice is a proforma + status is Completed. Default off; auto-flips on only when the entered amount (directly or via FX) covers the invoice's remaining balance. Heuristic freezes once the operator toggles. Conversion fires post-create so a failure surfaces without rolling back the payment.
  - `useInvoicePaymentMutation` now invalidates the booking-scoped payment lists (`admin-booking-payments`) so the table refreshes after recording.

  **Proforma → invoice linkage**

  - `getInvoiceById` returns `convertedToInvoiceId` + `convertedToInvoiceNumber` (the inverse of `convertedFromInvoiceId`). The invoice sheet shows a green "Invoiced" / "Facturat" status with a deep link to the final invoice when a void proforma was converted. Converted proformas are filtered out of the invoices table on the booking detail page.

  **New booking dialog**

  - The three document-related checkboxes (Generate contract / Generate invoice / Create as draft) collapse into two mutually-exclusive options: "Generate proforma" and "Generate invoice and contract". `invoiceType` plumbs through the catalog booking-engine contract, products handler, finance service, and react hook.

  **Misc**

  - SmartBill plugin honors a new `skipExternalSync` flag on `invoice.issued` / `invoice.proforma.issued` so per-invoice opt-out from external sync is possible.
  - SmartBill rate-limit date parser now anchors `24/05/2026 09:32:48`-style timestamps to UTC instead of the JS host's local time. The instant decoded from the same response is now identical on CI (UTC) and on developer machines in non-UTC zones (e.g. Europe/Bucharest, EEST). Fixes a pre-existing test failure when running locally outside UTC.
  - Bookings list excludeStatuses filter (string-or-array) parsed by `bookingListQuerySchema`.
  - `BookingPaymentsSummary` adds an FX equivalent column with `baseCurrency` + `baseAmountCents` plumbed through `publicFinanceBookingPaymentSchema` and the operator `useAdminBookingPayments` projection.
  - Currency combobox now correctly disables (forwards `disabled` to the inner input and hides the clear button when disabled).
  - New shared primitives in `@voyant-travel/bookings-ui`: `IconActionButton` (icon button with built-in tooltip) and `StatusBadge` (semantic tone mapping for status strings) — exported from the package root.

### Patch Changes

- 819c847: Ship the composed trip admin workflow and booking extras integration.

  Admin surfaces now include trip list/detail/composer routes, catalog-backed
  trip assembly, aggregate checkout handoff, payment-link trip summaries, and
  trip-aware navigation. Booking journeys and regular booking creation can route
  operators into the composer when the customer is building a multi-component
  itinerary.

  Catalog booking draft shapes now expose richer add-on offers, and owned product
  booking handlers can price and commit selected extras. Product detail pages can
  manage extras, booking create can select extras, and finance booking creation
  persists selected extras as booking items so invoices and payment links include
  them.

  Checkout payment pages now render clearer trip summaries, flight booking UI
  supports the refined baggage/one-way behavior used by the composer, shared UI
  exports the date-time field, and i18n includes the new trip admin copy.

- 3e09123: Quiet/auxiliary updates.

  - `@voyant-travel/notifications`: `booking.confirmed` subscriber honors a new `suppressNotifications` flag on the event payload so operators can confirm a booking without firing the customer-facing email/doc bundle (data corrections, manual hand-offs).
  - `@voyant-travel/customer-portal`: public service + validation tightened around the new booking tax-preview shape; integration tests updated to assert the new response.
  - `@voyant-travel/i18n`: new admin strings for the bookings billing dialog, finance tax-preview labels, CRM operator screens, and products operator surface (EN + RO).

- deaacb3: Add a `manageAvailabilityAction` message under `products.products` (en + ro) used by the dmc product detail page's new "Manage availability" button (which deep-links into `/availability?productId=…`).

## 0.51.0

### Patch Changes

- 2316791: Redesign `AvailabilitySlotDetailPage` from a debug-dump card stack into a tabbed workspace.

  - One compact header (product name + date range + nights + status pills) replaces the start-date-concatenated-with-itself title and the three "Unlimited / Past Cutoff / Too Early : Yes/No" rows.
  - 4-cell **KPI strip** (pax remaining/initial, product, date, notes).
  - 5-tab body: **Allocation** (default) · **Pickup** · **Closeouts** · **Activity** · **Meta**. Counts render as badges on the tab triggers; empty tabs show one inline message instead of a full empty card. Activity bundles the audit log + resource-assignment list; Meta holds identifiers + lifecycle timestamps.
  - Null detail rows (rule / start time / ends at / initial pickups / remaining pickups / remaining resources) hide instead of rendering a dash.
  - New slot props on the package:
    - `breadcrumb?: ReactNode` — host renders breadcrumbs in its own chrome (sidebar inset top bar).
    - `headerActions?: ReactNode` — host can override the in-page Open product / Delete buttons and render them elsewhere.
    - `renderAllocation?: ({ slotId, productId }) => ReactNode` — host mounts the allocation manager (keeps `availability-ui` free of any runtime dependency on `allocation-ui`).
  - Product / start time rows in the Meta tab are real links via the existing `onOpenProduct` / `onOpenStartTime` callbacks.

  `@voyant-travel/i18n`: new keys under `availability.details.tabs.*` for the detail page's tabbed body (en + ro).

### Patch Changes

- 4a6523e: Reminder sequences UI (#488).

  New `@voyant-travel/notifications-ui` package with the reminder-sequence editing surface:

  - `<StageList />` — ordered stages per rule, with reorder + delete and an embedded channel list.
  - `<StageEditorDialog />` — anchor / window / cadence (`once` | `every_n_days` | `escalating(buckets[])`) / `maxSendsInStage` / `respectQuietHours`.
  - `<StageChannelList />` + `<StageChannelEditorDialog />` — per-stage multi-channel rows (channel, template, recipient kind, optional role).
  - `<NotificationSettingsForm />` — quiet hours / blackout dates / weekend skip / recipient daily cap / suppression window.
  - `<RemindersPreviewList />` — read-only "what would fire on this date" table with reasoning per row.
  - Full en/ro i18n with `NotificationsUiMessagesProvider`.

  Hooks added to `@voyant-travel/notifications-react`:

  - `useReminderRuleStages`, `useReminderRuleStageMutation` (create, update, delete, reorder)
  - `useReminderStageChannels`, `useReminderStageChannelMutation`
  - `useNotificationSettings`, `useNotificationSettingsMutation`
  - `useRemindersPreview`

  Operator template wires up three new routes (`/notifications/reminder-rules/:id`, `/notifications/preview`, `/notifications/settings`) and the operator nav gains Preview + Settings entries.

## 0.28.3

### Patch Changes

- 60ef432: Let templates lift the search + filter row out of the overview cards and into the page header (matching the rest of the operator shell), and accept a per-tab toolbar slot.

  `@voyant-travel/availability-ui`:

  - `<AvailabilityOverview />` accepts `showFilters?: boolean` (default `true`). When `false`, the inline search input + product filter + clear-filters button row is hidden so the consuming page can render the same controls in its own header without duplication. KPI cards and the rest of the overview still render unchanged.
  - `<AvailabilitySlotsTab />`, `<AvailabilityRulesTab />`, `<AvailabilityStartTimesTab />`, `<AvailabilityCloseoutsTab />`, `<AvailabilityPickupPointsTab />` each accept an optional `toolbar?: ReactNode` rendered between the selection action bar and the data table — for tab-scoped filter chips, pickers, etc.

  `@voyant-travel/availability-react`:

  - `ProductListFilters` now accepts an optional `search` string, threaded through `getProductsQueryOptions` as a `?search=` query-string parameter so product pickers can autocomplete server-side.

  `@voyant-travel/resources-ui`:

  - `<ResourcesOverview />` accepts `showFilters?: boolean` (default `true`) with the same semantics as the availability overview — hides the inline search + kind-filter row when the consuming page surfaces those controls in its header.

  `@voyant-travel/i18n`:

  - Admin resources messages add `filtersButton`, `filtersKindLabel`, `filtersSupplierLabel` / `filtersSupplierAny` / `filtersSupplierEmpty`, `filtersProductLabel` / `filtersProductAny` / `filtersProductEmpty` (en + ro) for the new header-level filter popover.

- 60ef432: Add a unified payments listing that joins customer and supplier payments into a single feed, and split the operator finance area into separate Invoices and Payments pages.

  `@voyant-travel/finance`:

  - New routes `GET /v1/admin/finance/payments` and `GET /v1/admin/finance/payments/:id`. The list endpoint accepts a `kind` filter (`customer` | `supplier`) plus the usual `status` / `paymentMethod` / `currency` / `invoiceId` / `bookingId` / `supplierId` / `paymentDateFrom` / `paymentDateTo` / `search` filters and `sortBy` (`amountCents` | `status` | `paymentDate` | `createdAt`) / `sortDir`. The detail endpoint dispatches by typeid prefix — `pay_*` resolves to a customer payment, `spay_*` resolves to a supplier payment. `bookingId` is applied to both branches: directly to `supplier_payments.booking_id` on the supplier side and via `invoices.booking_id` (joined as `i`) on the customer side, so a booking-scoped query no longer returns unrelated customer rows.
  - `financeService.listAllPayments(db, query)` and `financeService.getPaymentById(db, id)` return a `UnifiedPaymentRow` shape with normalized fields (`personName`, `organizationName`, `supplierName`, `invoiceNumber`, `bookingNumber`) joined in via SQL so the operator UI doesn't need follow-up lookups.
  - New exports: `UnifiedPaymentRow` (service.ts) and `paymentKindSchema` / `paymentListQuerySchema` / `paymentListSortFieldSchema` / `paymentListSortDirSchema` (validation-payments.ts).

  `@voyant-travel/finance-react`:

  - New hooks: `useAllPayments(filters)` and `usePayment(id)` plus the underlying `getAllPaymentsQueryOptions` / `getPaymentQueryOptions` query-options factories.
  - New types: `FinancePaymentKind`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListFilters`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListSortField`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListSortDir`.
  - New schemas: `paymentKindSchema`, `unifiedPaymentRecordSchema`, `allPaymentsListResponse`, `paymentSingleResponse`, plus matching `UnifiedPaymentRecord` type.
  - New invoice-payment-mutation invalidation now also invalidates `financeQueryKeys.allPayments()` so the unified feed stays in sync with single-invoice payment flows.

  `@voyant-travel/admin`:

  - Operator nav `finance` entry now points at `/finance/invoices` and exposes an `items` sub-nav with `invoices` and `payments` links, matching the new operator page split.

  `@voyant-travel/i18n`:

  - Operator nav messages add `invoices` and `payments` (en + ro).
  - Admin finance messages add `invoicesPageTitle`/`invoicesPageDescription`, `paymentsPageTitle`/`paymentsPageDescription`, `recordPayment`, `searchPaymentsPlaceholder`, `kindColumn`/`kindCustomer`/`kindSupplier`/`partyColumn`/`filtersKindLabel`/`filtersKindAll`, plus the `paymentDetail` and `recordPaymentDialog` message groups (en + ro).

- 60ef432: Reject the contradictory combination of `option_price_rules.pricing_mode = "per_booking"` and child per-unit prices, and stop the admin UI from offering the unit-pricing matrix on a per-booking rule (#482).

  Before: an `option_price_rule` with `pricingMode = "per_booking"` could carry rows in `option_unit_price_rules`. The storefront totaller in `service-departures.ts` switches on the _unit-level_ `pricingMode`, so the rule-level `per_booking` badge was effectively cosmetic — the rule said "single flat amount per booking", the math actually multiplied per-unit prices by quantity. Operators saw "Per Booking" and reasonably expected a flat charge; the system did something different.

  After:

  - `pricingService.createOptionUnitPriceRule` rejects (400) creating a unit-price row whose parent rule has `pricingMode = "per_booking"`.
  - `pricingService.updateOptionPriceRule` rejects (400) flipping a rule to `pricingMode = "per_booking"` when child unit-price rows already exist.
  - The product-options pricing form in the operator template and apps/dev hides the unit-pricing matrix when the rule is per-booking and shows a helper pointing the user at Per Person / Starting From if they want unit-level prices.
  - New i18n key `priceRules.perBookingFlatHint` (en + ro).

  Choosing one mode over the other isn't lossy — operators on rules currently configured as `per_booking` with unit prices were already getting the unit-level math; the badge will now match the math after they switch the rule's mode (typically to `per_person` or `per_unit` at the unit level).

### Patch Changes

- dc46e37: First-class per-departure price overrides (#467).

  Operators can now opt a single departure out of the seasonal `priceSchedule` layer by setting an explicit per-unit price. Resolved at snapshot time before option price rules: a unit with an active override on a given departure gets that override's amount; units without an override fall through to the schedule-matched rule.

  **`@voyant-travel/pricing`**

  - New `departure_price_overrides` table (TypeID prefix `dpov`). One row per `(departureId × optionUnitId × priceCatalogId)` with `sellAmountCents`, optional `costAmountCents`, `active` flag, `notes`, `metadata`.
  - Service + admin REST CRUD at `/v1/admin/pricing/departure-overrides`.
  - New `loadDeparturePriceOverrides` helper in `service-rule-resolver`.
  - Public pricing snapshot consumes overrides when `departureId` is passed: per-unit `sellAmountCents` is replaced for matching units. Backward-compatible — without `departureId`, the snapshot is unchanged.
  - Migrations shipped for the `operator` and `dmc` templates.
  - 5 integration tests covering: override beats unit price for the targeted unit, falls through when absent, respects `active=false`, multi-unit overrides coexist, no overrides applied when `departureId` is omitted.

  **`@voyant-travel/pricing-react`**

  - New hooks: `useDeparturePriceOverrides`, `useDeparturePriceOverride`, `useDeparturePriceOverrideMutation`.
  - New query options: `getDeparturePriceOverridesQueryOptions`, `getDeparturePriceOverrideQueryOptions`.
  - New record schema + paginated/single response envelopes.

  **`@voyant-travel/i18n`**

  - Admin strings for the operator template's "Override pricing" affordance and "Custom price" badge (EN + RO).

## 0.26.9

### Patch Changes

- 24a121e: Add admin strings for the simplified per-unit pricing table (#466).

  The operator UI now hides the unit×category pricing matrix when a price rule uses `pricingMode = "per_person"` and `allPricingCategories = true` — the pax-bucket unit (Adult / Child / Infant) already encodes the differentiation, so the 12-column room/group/category matrix is just noise on day-trip products. Three new strings power the simplified table:

  - `products.operations.priceRules.unitPricingTitle` — section title when the simple table renders
  - `products.operations.priceRules.tableSell` — Sell column header
  - `products.operations.priceRules.tableCost` — Cost column header (reserved for future per-unit cost editing)

  Existing `unitCategoryTitle` and `tableUnit` strings still drive the full matrix when `allPricingCategories` is off.
