### Patch Changes

- 7a7fd97: Strengthen the internationalization platform across the operator and package UI.

  Add ICU message formatting, explicit locale and time-zone formatters, hierarchical
  locale fallback, validated runtime overrides, account-authoritative preferences,
  localized setup and navigation surfaces, and fail-closed catalog and UI-literal
  checks. Package message providers now accept an optional time zone and expose the
  shared formatting capabilities to package-owned UI.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 82ffd12: Add persisted organization-level first-run setup guidance composed from the
  selected admin graph. Standard Operator deployments now collect package-owned
  business profile, storefront, market, fiscal, navigation, team, and first-product
  steps while keeping domain mutations in their existing package surfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 7e9f77a: Add organization defaults and member overrides for stable admin navigation IDs. Apply visibility
  after selected navigation composition without exposing ineligible routes, inherit hidden parent
  state through navigation subtrees, and retain structural parents only when a child is explicitly
  re-enabled. Ship the persistence, admin API, provisioning seam, and settings UI in standard Operator
  deployments, with duplicate settings contributions normalized at the host and core boundaries.

### Patch Changes

- d83d237: Repair packaged consumer development and production startup, keep shared UI
  contexts single-instanced under Vite, make unconfigured realtime quiet, and
  restore narrow client-safe validation and Finance voucher setup exports. Resolve
  legacy frontend imports through product-owned browser facades and allow clean CI
  installs to fetch metadata for external dependencies.

### Minor Changes

- c65b05c: Own authenticated workspace composition behind injected auth, realtime, API, and presentation ports.
- c65b05c: Generate standard Operator route registrations under `.voyant`, move public
  Finance and Quotes route behavior into package-owned contributions, and move
  standard route composition into the product distribution so application source
  contains only deployment adapters and local customization.
- c65b05c: Move the standard Operator frontend runtime, route adapters, API documentation,
  provider stack, and stylesheet bootstrap from the generic admin host into the
  standard product distribution.
- 490d132: Package reusable admin host destinations, dashboard and extension composition,
  current-user bindings, and realtime invalidation presentation.
- 490d132: Remove the final snapshot-era managed-profile aliases from the admin and migration package surfaces. Admin hosts now consume `AdminAuthRuntime`, `getAdminApiUrl`, and `adminFetcher`; deployment migration collection is exposed as `collectDeploymentMigrationSources`.
- 490d132: Remove the framework's snapshot-era profile, managed runtime, managed jobs, profile-to-graph conversion, and dynamic profile composition exports. Graph projects and the generic Node runtime are now the only framework deployment authority; generic deployment mode and provider validation remain supported.
- 282892e: Make `@voyant-travel/runtime` the single public Node project host, move low-level
  host primitives to `@voyant-travel/runtime-core`, and remove the package-owned
  runtime CLI. Rename remaining first-party operator-specific subpaths to generic
  runtime or runtime-support surfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 490d132: Move built-in admin route message providers into route-owned contribution metadata and remove first-party package fallback knowledge from the generic admin host.
- 490d132: Move Operator Settings and Relationships admin presentation authority into selected package graph factories.
- 490d132: Build admin destinations from the graph-selected and project-local extension registry instead of committed generated source files.
- 490d132: Compose selected-graph and project-local admin extensions through the generic admin host, and declare Realtime's admin integration directly in its package manifest.

### Patch Changes

  - @voyant-travel/runtime-core@0.5.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 5cfe27d: Add `@voyant-travel/admin-host` — a profile-agnostic package that packages the
  managed-profile admin **serving seam** (Phase 1 of the source-free admin host,
  voyant#3044).

  - `serveManagedProfileAdmin({ clientAssetsDir, app })` — a Hono app that serves
    built client assets, then falls through to the combined API + SSR app for
    every non-asset route (the Node static host admin deployments held inline).
  - `createManagedProfileAdminSsrHandler()` — the TanStack Start SSR handler wrap
    (`createStartHandler(withActiveRouteSsrManifest(defaultStreamHandler))`), so
    hosts don't reimplement it; it still relies on the consuming app's Start build
    to provide the router.

  Naming is profile-agnostic (`createManagedProfileAdmin*`, never "operator" in an
  identifier) so any managed profile reuses the same host. The operator starter
  adopts both seams; the router assembly and app-shell routes remain starter-owned
  until Phase 2.
