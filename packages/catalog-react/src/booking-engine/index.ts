/**
 * `@voyantjs/catalog-react/booking-engine` — React Query hooks
 * driving the unified booking journey shell.
 *
 * Per `docs/architecture/booking-journey-architecture.md` §8.1.
 *
 * Hooks:
 *   - `useBookingDraft`       — local draft state with server sync
 *   - `useBookingQuote`       — debounced live quote on draft change
 *   - `useBookingDraftShape`  — convenience accessor on the latest quote
 *   - `useBookingCommit`      — final book mutation, triggers handoff
 *
 * The hooks share a `useBookingJourneyApi()` accessor that derives
 * the API base from the surrounding `VoyantCatalogProvider` and
 * lets callers override the surface (`/v1/admin` vs `/v1/public`).
 *
 * Identical surface for operator and storefront — Phase B's "build
 * once, ship everywhere" rule (§ Rule 4).
