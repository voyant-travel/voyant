### Patch Changes

- cfa6af8: feat(finance): accounts-payable supplier invoices, profitability & end-to-end FX

  Adds the full accounts-payable vertical for #1506:

  - **Supplier invoices (AP)**: `supplier_invoices` / `supplier_invoice_lines` /
    `supplier_cost_allocations`, the `supplierInvoicesService` (create/update/
    setLines/setAllocations/payments), attachments, and admin API routes.
  - **Cost allocation**: two-step product → departure picker, configurable cost
    categories (managed under Settings), searchable comboboxes.
  - **Profitability**: per-departure / per-product / per-traveller P&L read model
    - dashboards, cost-by-category breakdown, charts, CSV export.
  - **Accountant share portal**: scoped, revocable token links (no login) exposing
    financials + client/supplier invoices with downloadable attachments, ZIP
    download, and an en/ro language switcher.
  - **End-to-end FX**: supplier invoices and cost allocations snapshot their
    accounting-base value at the FX rate effective on the issue date; the
    profitability rollup sums those recorded snapshots (per-transaction-date
    rates) instead of re-valuing aggregates at the latest rate.

  Supporting additive exports: `availability`/`bookings`/`suppliers` schema and
  linkable exports consumed by the finance read model, and new TypeID prefixes in
  `schema-kit`.

### Patch Changes

- 577eaf5: Add in-context translations for products and itinerary days.

  - `@voyantjs/products`: add a `products.default_language_tag` column (the language the base name/description columns are written in) and a new `product_day_translations` table (per-language title/description/location) with CRUD service methods and routes under `/v1/products/:id/days/:dayId/translations`.
  - `@voyantjs/products-contracts`: validation schemas for the product default language and itinerary-day translations.
  - `@voyantjs/products-react`: `useProductDayTranslations` / `useProductDayTranslationMutation` hooks, record/response schemas, and query keys; the product record now exposes `defaultLanguageTag`.
  - `@voyantjs/schema-kit`: `product_day_translations` TypeID prefix (`pdtr`).
  - `@voyantjs/i18n`: operator labels for the content-language switcher, default language, itinerary-day sheet, and market-rule columns.

### Minor Changes

- 7094c8e: Add `@voyantjs/schema-kit` and extend the `*-contracts` pattern to the
  operational modules.

  `@voyantjs/schema-kit` (pure: zod + typeid-js) is the new foundational home for
  schema primitives shared by the runtime and the contract packages — the TypeID
  system (prefix registry, id generation, zod validators), `booleanQueryParam`,
  and `kmsEnvelopeSchema`. These moved out of `@voyantjs/db` (which now re-exports
  them from their original paths, so every call-site is unchanged) so they sit
  below the data layer and the contract packages can depend on them without
  pulling Drizzle.

  New zod-only contract packages own each module's validation surface (schemas +
  enums): `@voyantjs/bookings-contracts`, `@voyantjs/finance-contracts`,
  `@voyantjs/crm-contracts`, `@voyantjs/transactions-contracts`,
  `@voyantjs/suppliers-contracts`, `@voyantjs/identity-contracts`, and
  `@voyantjs/legal-contracts`. Each runtime module re-exports from its contracts
  package, so existing `@voyantjs/<module>/validation` import paths are unchanged.
  Shared primitives come from `@voyantjs/schema-kit`, keeping the contract
  packages free of the data layer.

  (`legal-contracts` still transitively depends on `@voyantjs/utils` for the
  template-syntax validator used by contract validation — a tracked follow-up
  would purify it.)
