# @voyant-travel/schema-kit

## 0.113.4

### Patch Changes

- a461920: Add the iframe admin session-token broker (RFC Phase 3): HKDF-signed,
  context-separated short-lived session tokens carrying issuer, app audience,
  installation, deployment, viewer, entity/slot context, iat/exp, and a unique
  token id. Issuance records the token id and audits it; the backend exchange
  verifies audience/deployment binding, consumes the token id once (rejecting
  replay, expiry, and context mismatch), and swaps it for online actor access via
  the existing OAuth actor-token-exchange primitive bounded by viewer ∩ app
  grants. Adds the `app_session_tokens` table (migration idx 4) and its TypeID
  prefix.

## 0.113.3

### Patch Changes

- 3a90c27: Add remote app OAuth authorization, token, rotation, revocation, and app-token auth context support.

## 0.113.2

### Patch Changes

- 9fc7801: Add remote app OAuth authorization, token, rotation, revocation, and app-token auth context support.

## 0.113.1

### Patch Changes

- 0868f18: Add the app registry foundation with closed manifest validation, deterministic release compilation, protected manifest ingestion, and admin API wiring.
- 027ca08: Add the app installation aggregate, lifecycle service, reconciliation tables, and TypeID prefixes for app installation records.

## 0.113.0

### Minor Changes

- 52352c4: Remove project-local TypeScript custom-field declarations, discovery globs,
  executable validation callbacks, and code/database merge helpers. The generic
  custom-fields package now owns canonical value routes and dispatches operations
  to selected entity-owning packages through typed runtime contributions, with no
  Relationships compatibility adapter.

## 0.112.2

### Patch Changes

- 5941d2c: Remove the unused action-ledger relay outbox schema, service, HTTP route, tool,
  and entry-detail UI. Ledger canaries now verify the append-only write path, and
  future exports/projections use cursor checkpoints while work-queue consumers use
  the framework's generic durable event outbox.

## 0.112.1

### Patch Changes

- 8d62a7c: Republish every affected TypeScript package without broken declaration maps so the corrected artifact
  policy reaches npm instead of applying only to future incidental package releases.

## 0.112.0

### Minor Changes

- bbe6396: Replace the overloaded Finance voucher domain with Travel Credits across the
  database schema, APIs, package exports, booking inputs, storefront settings,
  and operator UI. Redemption commands are replay-safe, codes are normalized and
  case-insensitively unique, and legacy records migrate in place without silently
  skipping invalid balances. Keep Promotion Codes in Commerce and move Bookings
  fulfillment to the explicit Service Voucher vocabulary.

## 0.111.1

### Patch Changes

- 6d3e0a5: Add first-party owned accommodation daily rates, room-night inventory, and a service-backed booking/search quote path.

## 0.111.0

### Minor Changes

- 722455d: RFP → bid → award sourcing funnel (Phase 4).

  - mice: `mice_rfps` + `mice_rfp_invitations` + `mice_bids` + `mice_bid_lines` +
    `mice_bid_evaluations` — multi-supplier bid solicitation, comparison, and
    scoring (the gap CRM quote/opportunity didn't cover). `awardRfp` atomically
    accepts the winning bid, rejects the rest, and moves the RFP to `awarded`.
    Service + admin routes + rfp/bid linkables; supplier-FK refs handled.
  - schema-kit: TypeID prefixes mrfp/mrfi/mbid/mbln/mbev.
  - Deployment link: bid↔supplier.

  Follow-up (workflow): the `mice.rfp.awarded` subscriber that auto-spawns the
  legal contract + provisional room block + booking is operator-side automation,
  deferred to a workflow PR.

## 0.110.0

### Minor Changes

- 06cfcf5: Delegate registry + rooming manifest + booking extension (Phase 3).

  - mice: `mice_program_delegates` (role + lifecycle status; PII stays on the
    linked CRM person/booking per §9-Q7) + `mice_delegate_session_enrollments`
    (idempotent per delegate+session); first-class rooming manifest
    (`mice_rooming_assignments` + `mice_rooming_assignment_delegates` join for
    shared rooms, §9-Q5); `booking_mice_details` HonoExtension on bookings.
    Services + admin routes + delegate/rooming linkables. FK refs validated
    up-front (4xx, not FK 500).
  - schema-kit: TypeID prefixes mpdl/mdse/mrma/mrad/bkmd.
  - Deployment links: delegate↔person, delegate↔booking, rooming↔roomBlock.

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- 787c852: Space blocks + shared allotment-lifecycle primitive (Phase 2b).

  - New `@voyant-travel/allotments`: the canonical allotment lifecycle contract
    (status state machine, counter math, pickup-progress derivation, slot
    enumeration) — one contract reused by type-specific tables (RFC §9-Q2).
  - accommodations: room-block service refactored onto the shared primitive
    (behavior-preserving; enum values unchanged, no migration).
  - operations: `space_blocks` / `space_block_slots` / `space_block_pickups` —
    held function-space inventory over a date range, the 2nd allotment consumer;
    transactional pickup/reversal/cutoff service + admin routes + `spaceBlockLinkable`.
  - schema-kit: TypeID prefixes `spbl` / `spsl` / `sppu`.

## 0.108.0

### Minor Changes

- 924d201: Room-block allotment (Phase 1) + MICE program spine.

  - accommodations: `room_blocks` / `room_block_nights` / `room_block_pickups` with
    per-night counters, CHECK invariants, an append-only pickup ledger, and a
    transactional pickup/reversal/cutoff-release service; first
    `accommodationsHonoModule` (registered in the framework standard set) +
    `roomBlockLinkable`.
  - operations: `property` / `facility` linkable definitions.
  - mice (new): `mice_programs` umbrella + admin routes + `programLinkable`,
    mounted operator-local.
  - schema-kit: TypeID prefixes `hrbn` / `hrbp` / `prog`.

- f311826: Function spaces + capacity-by-layout (operations) and agenda sessions (mice) — Phase 2.

  - operations: `function_spaces` (venue sub-spaces, nestable via `parentSpaceId`
    for combinable rooms / exhibition booths) + `function_space_capacities`
    (per-layout headcount: theater / classroom / banquet / cabaret / boardroom /
    u_shape / reception / hollow_square); service + admin routes + `functionSpaceLinkable`.
  - mice: `mice_program_sessions` (timed, capacity-bound agenda items with
    session type + optional function-space link) + `mice_session_inclusions`
    (F&B / AV / materials / signage); service + admin routes + `sessionLinkable`.
  - schema-kit: TypeID prefixes `fnsp` / `fnsc` / `mpss` / `mssi`.

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- b68d6a7: Add the dynamic-packaging requirement/candidate model to Trips (voyant#2082 / voyant#1600) — keystone gap 2.

  - **`@voyant-travel/trips`** — new `trip_requirements` (unresolved customer need on an envelope: vertical + criteria + criteriaVersion mirroring the catalog `AvailabilitySearchRequest`) and `trip_candidates` (a normalized `AvailabilityCandidate` attached to a requirement: rank, status, origin, decimal price, TTL, internal `providerData`) tables, with enums, relations, and migration `0001`. Service operations: `addRequirement`, `sourceRequirementCandidates` (runs a deployment-injected availability fan-out, persists the ranked set), `selectCandidate` (enforces selected-uniqueness, pins a draft catalog component the existing price/reserve pipeline re-validates), `reshopRequirement` / `reshopTrip`, and `expireStaleTripCandidates` (TTL reaper). `reserveTrip` now gates on all required requirements being resolved. The fan-out is injected (`SourceRequirementCandidatesDeps`), never a named provider.
  - **`@voyant-travel/schema-kit`** — register TypeID prefixes `trrq` (trip_requirements) and `trcd` (trip_candidates).

  Additive; no behavioral change to existing trip flows (an envelope with no requirements reserves exactly as before).

## 0.106.2

### Patch Changes

- e799cea: Fix duplicate TypeID prefix `pdst`: `product_day_service_translations` (added in #2067) collided with the existing `product_destinations`. Re-prefix the day-service-translations table to `pdsr` so prefix→table lookup is unambiguous and the `db` "no duplicate prefix" test passes.

## 0.106.1

### Patch Changes

- fcd2e0b: Add itinerary and day-service translation authoring surfaces, and localize owned itinerary content projection for translated days and service labels.

## 0.106.0

### Minor Changes

- a74471e: Register the `quote_media` TypeID prefix (`qmed`) for quote images/attachments.

## 0.105.3

### Patch Changes

- e80e3d3: Add Trips reservation plans and route active plan submission through Bookings.

## 0.105.2

### Patch Changes

- f25e790: New `@voyant-travel/db/write-intents` + `write_intents` table (TypeID prefix `wint`) — the queued write pipeline's result mailbox (RFC #1687 Phase 3.2). **Requires the `write_intents` migration.** `enqueueWriteIntent` dedups on `idempotencyKey` (a retried POST returns the SAME intent), `settleWriteIntent` only transitions pending rows (at-least-once redelivery after success is a no-op), and `expireStaleWriteIntents` backstops intents whose event dead-lettered in the outbox.

## 0.105.1

### Patch Changes

- b7056f1: New `@voyant-travel/db/outbox` module + `event_outbox` table (`schema/infra`, TypeID prefix `evob`) — the Postgres half of the transactional outbox (RFC #1687 Phase 2.1). **Requires the `event_outbox` migration.**

  - `createOutboxEventStore(getDb)` — plugs into `createEventBus`'s durable emit.
  - `insertOutboxEvents(dbOrTx, envelopes)` — atomic capture inside a domain transaction ("transactional outbox" proper); dedups on `metadata.eventId`.
  - `claimDueOutboxEvents` — visibility-timeout claiming (single statement, `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` subquery — safe on neon-http and under concurrent drains; a crashed claimer's rows simply become due again).
  - `drainOutbox(db, bus, opts)` — claim → redeliver via `bus.deliver` → complete / reschedule with exponential backoff (5s·2^attempts, 15min cap, jitter) / dead-letter after `max_attempts`.
  - `pruneDeliveredOutboxEvents`, `getOutboxStats`.

  Delivery is **at-least-once**: subscribers must be idempotent (the workflow forwarder already dedups on eventId; plugin subscribers key on external refs).

  Also: `createTestDb()` disables the Phase-1 default statement/query timeouts for test clients — `cleanupTestDb`'s full-schema TRUNCATE could exceed the 10s production default and kill integration-suite setup.

## 0.105.0

### Minor Changes

- d1ad572: Rename CRM sales artifacts from Opportunities to Quotes, split Quote Versions into their own schema/API surface, and update the corresponding TypeID prefixes.
- d1ad572: Add composer-owned Trip snapshot freezing and read APIs for Quote Version proposal snapshots.

## 0.104.2

### Patch Changes

- cfa6af8: feat(finance): accounts-payable supplier invoices, profitability & end-to-end FX

  Adds the full accounts-payable vertical for #1506:

  - **Supplier invoices (AP)**: `supplier_invoices` / `supplier_invoice_lines` /
    `supplier_cost_allocations`, the `supplierInvoicesService` (create/update/
    setLines/setAllocations/payments), attachments, and admin API routes.
  - **Cost allocation**: two-step product → departure picker, configurable cost
    categories (managed under Settings), searchable comboboxes.
  - **Profitability**: per-departure / per-product / per-traveller P&L read model
    - dashboards, cost-by-category breakdown, charts, CSV export.
  - **Accountant share portal**: scoped, revocable token links (no login) exposing
    financials + client/supplier invoices with downloadable attachments, ZIP
    download, and an en/ro language switcher.
  - **End-to-end FX**: supplier invoices and cost allocations snapshot their
    accounting-base value at the FX rate effective on the issue date; the
    profitability rollup sums those recorded snapshots (per-transaction-date
    rates) instead of re-valuing aggregates at the latest rate.

  Supporting additive exports: `availability`/`bookings`/`suppliers` schema and
  linkable exports consumed by the finance read model, and new TypeID prefixes in
  `schema-kit`.

### Patch Changes

- 577eaf5: Add in-context translations for products and itinerary days.

  - `@voyant-travel/products`: add a `products.default_language_tag` column (the language the base name/description columns are written in) and a new `product_day_translations` table (per-language title/description/location) with CRUD service methods and routes under `/v1/products/:id/days/:dayId/translations`.
  - `@voyant-travel/products-contracts`: validation schemas for the product default language and itinerary-day translations.
  - `@voyant-travel/products-react`: `useProductDayTranslations` / `useProductDayTranslationMutation` hooks, record/response schemas, and query keys; the product record now exposes `defaultLanguageTag`.
  - `@voyant-travel/schema-kit`: `product_day_translations` TypeID prefix (`pdtr`).
  - `@voyant-travel/i18n`: operator labels for the content-language switcher, default language, itinerary-day sheet, and market-rule columns.

### Minor Changes

- 7094c8e: Add `@voyant-travel/schema-kit` and extend the `*-contracts` pattern to the
  operational modules.

  `@voyant-travel/schema-kit` (pure: zod + typeid-js) is the new foundational home for
  schema primitives shared by the runtime and the contract packages — the TypeID
  system (prefix registry, id generation, zod validators), `booleanQueryParam`,
  and `kmsEnvelopeSchema`. These moved out of `@voyant-travel/db` (which now re-exports
  them from their original paths, so every call-site is unchanged) so they sit
  below the data layer and the contract packages can depend on them without
  pulling Drizzle.

  New zod-only contract packages own each module's validation surface (schemas +
  enums): `@voyant-travel/bookings-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/finance-contracts`,
  `@voyant-travel/crm-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/transactions-contracts`,
  `@voyant-travel/suppliers-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/identity-contracts`, and
  `@voyant-travel/legal-contracts`. Each runtime module re-exports from its contracts
  package, so existing `@voyant-travel/<module>/validation` import paths are unchanged.
  Shared primitives come from `@voyant-travel/schema-kit`, keeping the contract
  packages free of the data layer.

  (`legal-contracts` still transitively depends on `@voyant-travel/utils` for the
  template-syntax validator used by contract validation — a tracked follow-up
  would purify it.)
