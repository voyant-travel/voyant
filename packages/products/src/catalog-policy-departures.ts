/**
 * Catalog plane field policy for product → departures denormalization.
 *
 * These fields don't live on the `products` table — they're aggregated
 * from `availability_slots` (filtered to `status = 'open'` and future
 * `startsAt`) at index time and projected onto the product search
 * document. See `docs/architecture/catalog-architecture.md` §5.4.
 *
 * Storefront product cards filter and display by departure surface:
 *   - "departing in May" (filter: `departureMonths[]` includes "2026-05")
 *   - "available this weekend" (filter: `departureDates[]` overlap)
 *   - "available now" (filter: `hasUpcomingDeparture:true`)
 *   - sort by next departure (`nextDepartureAt` asc)
 *   - show capacity badge (`availableUnitsTotal`)
 *
 * Wire this policy into the products registry by composing with
 * `productCatalogPolicy`:
 *
 *   const registry = createFieldPolicyRegistry([
 *     ...productCatalogPolicy,
 *     ...productDeparturesCatalogPolicy,
 *   ])
 *
 * and wire `createProductDeparturesProjectionExtension` into
 * `createProductDocumentBuilder` so the values land in the doc.
 *
 * Reindex semantics: every aggregation depends on `now()` — the same
 * product reindexed an hour later will produce slightly different
 * documents because the future window slides. Operators rely on the
 * channel-push reconciler + scheduled refresh to keep these fields warm
 * without storming the indexer on each tick. Per architecture §5.4,
 * `reindex: "facet-affecting"` is the right tier — these fields drive
 * facets but aren't on the merchandisable hot path.
 *
 * Out of scope here:
 *   - Sold-out / cancelled / closed slots. The projection only counts
 *     `status = 'open'` so storefront filters never surface unavailable
 *     departures. A "show sold-out" toggle is a query-time concern.
 *   - Per-option splits. Today's projection rolls up to the product;
 *     per-option faceting is a follow-up if storefronts need it.
 *   - Duration buckets (nights/days). Slots carry these but products
 *     with mixed-duration slots can't be summarized in one number.
