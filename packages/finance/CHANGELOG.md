## 0.169.1

### Patch Changes

- c013955: Wire the booking-tax settings and preview route options through the runtime
  container so the managed runtime's operator-settings resolvers always reach the
  routes.

  On the managed runtime every runtime export of a graph unit is invoked: the
  `defineGraphRuntimeFactory` export receives the factory context and wires the
  operator-settings port into options, while the plain api-facet export is called
  with no args and therefore saw empty options. Because the api-facet previously
  returned an eager `adminRoutes` set built from those empty options, `PATCH
/v1/admin/finance/tax-settings` failed with `Booking tax settings updates are
not configured`.

  The booking-tax settings/preview extensions now mirror the booking-schedule
  pattern: the graph factory registers the wired options into the shared app
  container under a runtime key during `bootstrap`, and the (now lazy) routes
  resolve those options from the container at request time, falling back to the
  closure options for standard callers that pass real options directly.

## 0.169.0

### Patch Changes

- 590d256: Republish with dependency ranges resolved. The prior tarballs for these packages
  carry raw `workspace:` specifiers (they were published outside the pnpm-aware
  release flow) and cannot be installed by consumers. Also fixes the `runtime`
  package's `prepack`, which rebuilt the entire workspace dependency closure on
  every publish — the slow build stalled the release train's publish step past its
  timeout and wedged the whole batch. `prepack` now builds only the package itself,
  matching every other package.

## 0.168.0

### Minor Changes

- 158c3a0: Move the finance tax-settings admin surface and drop the operator FX reference-source setting.

  - **Tax settings moved to the finance surface.** `GET`/`PATCH /tax-settings`
    now serve from `/v1/admin/finance/tax-settings` instead of
    `/v1/admin/bookings/tax-settings`. On the managed operator runtime admin
    routes dispatch per-unit with prefix-first-match, so the bookings package's
    `GET /{id}` route was capturing `/tax-settings` (id = "tax-settings") and
    returning 404 — leaving the Settings → Invoicing controls permanently
    disabled. The booking-tax extension now splits into two separate
    extensions — `finance.booking-tax-settings-extension` (module `finance`,
    the `GET`/`PATCH tax-settings` routes on `mount: "finance"`) and
    `finance.booking-tax-preview-extension` (module `bookings`, the
    `POST /v1/admin/bookings/tax-preview` route, where it does not collide and
    `bookings-react` consumes it). They must be distinct extensions because the
    selected-graph composition yields one composed extension per `defineExtension`
    (keyed on localId); collapsing both facets into one extension dropped the
    preview route. The operator standard distribution registers both, attributing
    settings to finance + operator-settings and preview to finance + bookings.
  - **Operator FX reference-source setting removed.** The FX reference _source_
    is not an operator choice: Voyant Cloud serves managed FX by default,
    self-hosters supply their own adapter through the `finance.fx-reference.runtime`
    port, and for jurisdictions like RO the source (BNR) is legally mandated. The
    operator-facing "Reference exchange rates" control, the `fxReferenceSource`
    field on the tax-settings surface, and the `fx_reference_source` column are
    removed (additive drop migration). The `finance.fx-reference.runtime` port and
    its `resolveReferenceRate` helper are kept as the self-host/managed adapter
    seam; the source is now the host adapter's own and reported only as an output
    label on the returned rate.

### Patch Changes

- @voyant-travel/bookings@0.168.0

## 0.167.0

### Minor Changes

- ca3713e: Scope the operator invoicing mode to the deferred bank-transfer payment path.

  Payment method now determines the document flow. Card payments always issue the fiscal invoice at checkout finalize and never consult `invoicing.mode`. Bank transfer (deferred payment) is the configurable path: `proforma-first` (now the default, matching the platform's historical behaviour) issues a proforma at order placement and mints the fiscal invoice on settlement; `direct` issues the fiscal invoice at order placement and collects the transfer against it.

  The mode consult that PR #3462 added to the checkout finalize saga is removed — finalize once again always issues the fiscal invoice (or converts an existing proforma). The mode is instead wired at the bank-transfer issuance site, and its default flips from `direct` to `proforma-first` (schema default, normalization, and an additive migration that also backfills existing rows). The finance proforma-conversion subscriber no longer gates on the mode: any fully-paid proforma converts, which is correct in every mode and avoids stranding a proforma left outstanding across a mode switch.

### Patch Changes

- @voyant-travel/bookings@0.167.0

## 0.166.0

### Minor Changes

- c3bdcbc: Wire checkout finalization to the operator invoicing mode. When an operator runs `proforma-first`, a fresh checkout now issues a proforma instead of a fiscal invoice; the fiscal invoice is minted later once the proforma settles. `direct` mode is unchanged, an explicitly requested proforma conversion always wins over the mode default, and deployments without an operator-settings runtime fall back to `direct`.
- 3062a73: Add an operator-configurable official FX reference-rate source and a dedicated
  Invoicing settings page.

  A new finance operator setting `fx.referenceSource` (`ecb` | `bnr`, default
  `ecb`) lives on the finance operator-settings row, is normalized on read, exposed
  through the finance operator-settings runtime port, and surfaced on the
  `/tax-settings` admin GET/PATCH schema.

  Finance also gains a `finance.fx-reference.runtime` port plus a typed
  `resolveReferenceRate({ base, quote, date })` helper that reads the operator's
  configured source and delegates to a host-provided implementation; hosts wire it
  to their own FX data source. When no provider is wired, an explicit reference-rate
  request throws a typed `FinanceFxReferenceSourceUnavailableError`. No existing
  invoice math is wired to it — this ships the setting and seam only, with zero
  behaviour change for existing deployments.

  Invoicing configuration moves off the Taxes settings page onto a new dedicated
  **Invoicing** settings page (registered in the admin settings navigation the same
  way Taxes is). The invoicing-mode section moves there and the new reference-rate
  Select is added alongside it (EN + RO); both read/write the shared `/tax-settings`
  surface. The Taxes page returns to purely tax content.

- 926ea47: Add the canonical payment adapter contract and public conformance kit, expose the payments deployment provider role, and route card-payment seams through explicit deployment adapter selection instead of processor package identity.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [926ea47]
  - @voyant-travel/payments@0.2.0
  - @voyant-travel/bookings@0.166.0

## 0.165.0

### Minor Changes

- d6a9973: Add proforma-first invoicing as standard finance behaviour. A new operator
  setting `invoicing.mode` (`direct` | `proforma-first`, default `direct`) lives on
  the finance operator-settings row and is exposed through the finance
  operator-settings runtime port. In `proforma-first` mode the finance
  proforma-conversion subscriber automatically mints the fiscal invoice from a
  proforma once it is fully settled (`invoice.settled` / `invoice.payment.recorded`),
  copying lines, assigning the fiscal number, linking both documents, and voiding
  the proforma. The admin invoices list shows a proforma kind badge and the tax
  settings page exposes the invoicing-mode toggle. Fiscal-provider sync stays in
  plugins. `direct` mode is unchanged — zero behaviour change for existing
  deployments.

- 8f0fa26: Make Hono the explicit sole server API runtime while moving package and
  deployment interfaces to role-based API vocabulary. Replace Hono-prefixed module,
  extension, bundle, lazy-route, and factory names with `Api*` names; move
  router-named domain runtime entry points to `./api-runtime`; and remove the old

## 0.160.0

### Minor Changes

- 701ccc4: Add approval-gated agent Tools for booking cancellation and invoice refunds issued as credit notes, with exact command fingerprint validation and linked action-ledger execution records.
- a2fd806: Add package-owned MCP Tools for atomic product composition, composed booking creation,
  and approval-gated invoice/proforma issue from bookings. Reuse the existing domain
  orchestrators, structural schemas, mutation ledgers, and post-commit events, and make
  approved invoice execution exactly idempotent.

### Patch Changes

- 372f4f4: Add a separately selectable Operations-owned dashboard Tool that composes the real aggregate
  services from Bookings, Finance, Inventory, Distribution, and Operations without crossing domain
  persistence boundaries. Require every underlying read scope and return structural source
  projections, KPIs, and bounded alerts.

  Complete the Quotes proposal lifecycle Tool surface with snapshot, send, accept, and decline
  capabilities, structural JSON-safe outputs, compatibility aliases, staff-only grants,
  confirmation, and graph-ledger/approval policy.

- db5adce: Fail closed before selected graph Tool dispatch by binding each capability to its action-ledger
  policy. Advertise invocation controls in discovery, enforce confirmation, target, idempotency,
  fingerprint, approval, and principal semantics, and record required-ledger execution outcomes.

  Keep the existing package-owned booking cancellation and invoice refund approval workflows as
  explicit handler-enforced policies so their domain-state fingerprints and atomic ledgers are not
  double-gated.

- 6604f9e: Expose structural output schemas for every first-party Tool that previously used an opaque runtime-only schema.

## 0.159.0

### Patch Changes

- 49f55d0: Keep catalog booking and checkout as a two-phase flow, and atomically convert
  owned-product availability holds into on-hold booking allocations without
  consuming capacity twice. Hold placement and release are now idempotent across
  retries and duplicate tokens, converted holds retain an audit link to their
  booking allocation, and checkout-only intents receive structured validation
  errors from the reservation route.
- 9c85101: Compile one canonical event catalog from selected package manifests and expose it through
  generated deployment artifacts, graph runtimes, a package-owned admin API, and an admin event
  reference page. Reject duplicate event type authorities while preserving legitimate emitters,
  and ratchet persistence mutation coverage in the phase-5 authority checker.

### Patch Changes

- 73ab096: Standardize first-party packages on package-owned deployment manifests, provider selection,
  access metadata, concrete event contracts, selected admin navigation, and published runtime
  references. Add Bookings Extras as an independently selected graph unit and remove the central
  admin navigation catalog.
  Link facets now distinguish entity `linkable` metadata from executable `definition` exports, and
  generated Node registries reject malformed definitions before service registration.
  Provider-owned required config and secrets now apply only when that provider is selected, so
  local and in-memory deployments do not require credentials for inactive remote providers.

## 0.156.0

### Minor Changes

- bbe6396: Replace the overloaded Finance voucher domain with Travel Credits across the
  database schema, APIs, package exports, booking inputs, storefront settings,
  and operator UI. Redemption commands are replay-safe, codes are normalized and
  case-insensitively unique, and legacy records migrate in place without silently
  skipping invalid balances. Keep Promotion Codes in Commerce and move Bookings
  fulfillment to the explicit Service Voucher vocabulary.

  installs to fetch metadata for external dependencies.

## 0.155.1

### Patch Changes

- cc85042: Make deployment provider selection authoritative for Node storage, cache, shared
  state, and rate limiting. Replace vendor-specific object-store bindings and R2
  shims with logical media/document stores, a memory provider, an AWS SDK v3
  S3-compatible provider, and package-selected custom adapters. Add a portable
  storage provider conformance runner, resolve adapters from the `storage.object`
  graph provider, and make provider config/secret/resource usage explicit. Keep
  distributed shared state and rate-limit KV authoritative by bypassing the
  cache-only process-local L1, and move guest booking lookups onto the selected
  atomic rate-limit store. Remove the former R2/SigV4 exports.

### Patch Changes

- 047c3f9: Move booking and payment runtime configuration behind package-owned graph factories and typed deployment ports.
- 490d132: Add package-owned runtime contributor APIs for deployment-supplied Bookings, Finance, and Quotes adapters.
- 490d132: Move Trips lifecycle composition, checkout FX handling, payment-policy readers, and workflow effects from the Operator starter into package-owned runtime surfaces.
- 490d132: Move standard first-party admin factories, package copy, slots, contributions, and icons into selected deployment graph composition.
- 490d132: Declare the remaining package-owned OpenAPI documents backed by committed operations and preserve exact graph API ownership at shared route mounts.
- 490d132: Derive the final package runtime bindings from generic deployment capabilities and primitives, with no product-specific generated runtime host resources.
- 490d132: Move the Finance, Legal, and Trips admin and public API surfaces onto package-owned selected-graph OpenAPI authority.
- 490d132: Declare package-owned runtime contributors in `voyant.package.v1` metadata and statically lower selected contributors into generated Node graph source. Node hosts now compose one generated contributor set from opaque host resources without enumerating first-party factories or package IDs.
- 490d132: Compose MCP tools and their service context from graph-selected package runtime exports instead of an Operator-owned product catalog.
- 490d132: Move runtime construction into BOM-selected domain contributors and replace the Finance target package with typed graph ports while keeping package dependencies acyclic.
- 490d132: Move catalog content configuration, booking financial lifecycle behavior, and catalog/commerce scheduled work behind package-owned graph factories and workflows.
- 490d132: Compose Action Ledger health from typed Bookings, Finance, and Inventory graph ports, consolidate Distribution channel-push composition into its domain package, and make Workflow Runs own runner registration authority.
- 490d132: Make package and project declarations the sole selected access authority, removing legacy catalog overlays and runtime synthesis.
- 490d132: Remove the final Operator admin factory compatibility registry by composing cross-domain behavior through package-owned selected graph slots and contributions.

### Patch Changes

- bbc2334: Expose booking tax settings through the finance admin route mount so local starters can reach `/v1/admin/finance/tax-settings` without the bookings detail route capturing the request.

## 0.139.0

### Minor Changes

- fc71db1: Add read-only agent tools (`./tools`) for four more domains, following the
  module-owned-tools pattern over each package's existing service:

  - `@voyant-travel/bookings`: `list_bookings` + `get_booking` (non-PII, `bookings:read`).
  - `@voyant-travel/finance`: `list_invoices` + `get_invoice` (`finance:read`).
  - `@voyant-travel/quotes`: `list_quotes` + `get_quote` (`quotes:read`).
  - `@voyant-travel/relationships`: `list_people` / `get_person` / `list_organizations` /
    `get_organization` (`crm:read`).

  The operator registers them on the in-deployment MCP server, so `/v1/admin/mcp` now
  serves trips, products, bookings, finance, quotes, and CRM tools, each gated per-tool
  by scope + audience.

- fc71db1: Add write/action + notification agent tools:

  - `@voyant-travel/quotes`: `accept_quote_version` (write, `quotes:write`,
    confirmation-required).
  - `@voyant-travel/finance`: `void_invoice` (destructive, `finance:void`,
    confirmation-required) — the void is a self-contained status transition.
  - `@voyant-travel/notifications`: `list_notification_deliveries` +
    `get_notification_delivery` (read, `notifications:read`).

  The operator registers them on the in-deployment MCP server. A `send_notification`
  tool is deliberately withheld (customer-facing dispatch is an abuse vector and needs
  the provider runtime + rate limiting); booking `cancel` / finance `refund` similarly
  need route-level runtime wiring and will follow as a separate increment.

### Patch Changes

- bcd76ae: Reject invalid or dangling pricing and tax reference-data before writing.
  `POST /v1/admin/pricing/price-schedules` now rejects a nonexistent
  `priceCatalogId` with a deterministic `invalid_reference` 400 instead of a 500.
  Tax regime rates are bounded to the 0..100 percent domain (matching the
  booking-tax calculator that divides by 100), and `POST
/v1/admin/finance/tax-policy-rules` rejects dangling `profileId`/`taxRegimeId`
  references with an `invalid_reference` 400 (mirroring the existing tax-class
  regime guard).
- 37e7758: Reject invalid supplier-invoice payable states: missing supplier ids, negative AP totals or line money values, line totals that do not match quantity times unit amount plus tax, and completed supplier payments above the payable balance. Supplier-invoice UI dialogs now derive line totals and block above-balance payment submissions.
- Updated dependencies [1544a59]

## 0.138.5

### Patch Changes

- ec41b3e: Harden customer invoice accounting invariants in finance routes. Direct invoice creation now handles duplicate invoice numbers and missing booking/person/organization references as structured 4xx responses, invoice and credit-note line totals are validated against quantity and unit amount, completed payments cannot overpay invoices, and credit notes cannot exceed the invoice balance due.

## 0.138.4

### Patch Changes

- a424cae: Show a clear checkout-provider configuration error when payment-link generation is attempted without a registered checkout runtime, and label the booking payment-link full-amount selector with user-facing copy instead of its internal sentinel.

## 0.138.3

### Patch Changes

- c081c71: Keep booking activity and metadata current for note, document, supplier, invoice, and payment child mutations.
- 3fc4487: Reject invalid booking-item finance subresource states: negative tax-line amounts, incomplete commission value bases, paid commissions without paid metadata, and deletion of active booking guarantees.
- aa0135c: Reject zero-value payment authorization and payment capture requests in payment-processing validation.
- 51003c6: Expose booking voucher redemptions in booking-scoped payment reads as voucher payment rows.

- 2427218: Create flight order payment sessions for bank-transfer booking intents.

## 0.137.5

### Patch Changes

- 0108ccf: Harden booking-confirmed side effects for at-least-once event delivery.

  Catalog now exposes an idempotent booking snapshot graph capture helper for
  event subscribers, so duplicate `booking.confirmed` deliveries observe existing
  snapshot rows instead of surfacing unique constraint errors. Finance now treats
  malformed payment-policy JSON as unset and falls back through the cascade,
  preventing schedule generation from throwing on missing `deposit.kind`.

## 0.137.4

## 0.134.0

### Minor Changes

- 51f7dea: Share one list-response contract instead of per-module copies (voyant#2109).

  `@voyant-travel/types` now owns the canonical offset-paginated list envelope: the `ListResponse<T>` type + `listResponse(data, { total, limit, offset })` builder, plus the zod `paginationSchema` (coerced `limit` 1–200 default 50, `offset` ≥0 default 0) and the `listResponseSchema(item)` factory. Both server services and `*-react` clients import from this single source.

  Server side: every module's local `paginate()` / inline `{ data, total, limit, offset }` construction now routes through the shared `listResponse` builder, and the count read is standardized on `count` internally — fixing the drift where finance, notifications and the legal contracts/policies services read `countResult[0]?.total` while every other module read `countResult[0]?.count` (their `count(*)` selects were aliased `total`; they are now aliased `count`). The returned shape is byte-for-byte identical.

  Client side: the ~23 copied `paginatedEnvelope` zod schemas across the `*-react` packages are replaced by re-exporting the shared `listResponseSchema` factory under the same `paginatedEnvelope` name, so consumers are unchanged.

  Input alignment: `finance-contracts` and `legal-contracts` pagination `limit` caps were raised from `.max(100)` to `.max(200)` to match the framework-wide max.

  Additive and non-breaking.

## 0.126.1

### Patch Changes

- 1841ce2: D.2 slice 1 (batch 2) — 14 more packages own + ship their migration history (db, relationships, quotes, identity, distribution, inventory, commerce, catalog, finance, notifications, legal, storefront, charters, cruises). Each baseline reproduces the framework bundle's tables column-for-column, and all package sources now apply together (fresh-D.2 union) without collision.

  Shared enums: the codebase inlines copies of some enums to avoid cross-package schema imports (e.g. `service_type` in distribution + inventory, `entity_type` in relationships + quotes). Per-package generation would emit duplicate `CREATE TYPE`, colliding on a fresh D.2 database. All package migrations now wrap `CREATE TYPE … AS ENUM(…)` in an idempotent `DO`-block guard (subset-safe; whichever source applies first creates the type, the rest no-op). The db package additionally owns the shared Postgres extensions (pg_trgm / unaccent) that downstream trigram indexes need on a fresh D.2 database (the retired bundle injected them; per-package sources did not). The batch-1 packages (operator-settings, action-ledger, workflow-runs, trips) get the same guard for uniformity. No runtime change. See `docs/architecture/migration-collector-d2.md`.

### Minor Changes

- e9d9dbb: Custom-fields unification (invoice consumption seam). `InvoiceDocumentRuntimeOptions` gains an optional `resolveCustomFields(db, invoice)` hook; when wired, its result is exposed to the invoice template as the `customFields` variable (`{{customFields.<key>}}`). Finance stays decoupled from `relationships` — the deployment provides the resolver where it builds the invoice-generation runtime (it holds the custom-field registry and reads the entity's `custom_fields` column, filtering with `customFieldsVisibleIn(registry, entity, "invoice")`). Completes the reader-consumption trio (export + search are package-side; invoice is deployment-rendered, so finance exposes the hook). See `docs/architecture/custom-fields-unification-adr.md`.

## 0.122.1

### Patch Changes

- fe775da: Allow card checkout invoice-target collections to use the planned document type so operators can choose proforma anchors before payment capture.

## 0.122.0

### Minor Changes

- c9de9c4: Provider-agnostic card-payment seam: `@voyant-travel/finance` defines the `CardPaymentStarter` contract (`./card-payment`), `@voyant-travel/plugin-netopia` provides `netopiaCardPaymentStarter()`, and the deployment selects its processor in one place. Swapping card processors is a one-line change; checkout surfaces (flights, trips, payment links, catalog) route through the interface.
- 14f4234: New generic order-payment-session service: `createOrderPaymentSessions({ targetType })` → `{ ensureSession, fetchSessions }` (from `@voyant-travel/finance` and `./order-payment-sessions`). Owns the "find live/settled session or create one, then optionally start the provider" logic generically over a target type, so deployments don't reimplement it per order kind.
- 89d4ca9: `@voyant-travel/finance` now owns the payment-policy cascade orchestration: new `createPaymentPolicyCascade(options)` (from `@voyant-travel/finance` and `./payment-policy-cascade`) composes the supplier → category → listing → operator-default precedence, with the vertical schema-walk readers injected (finance must not import the verticals per the retail-spine gate). The bookings-only `__payment_policy_source__` marker protocol (`stampPolicySourceOnBooking` / `readPolicySourceFromInternalNotes`) and the canonical `PaymentPolicyEntityContext` type also move to finance, de-duplicating the prior definition in `payment-schedule/routes.ts`.

### Patch Changes

- 51dd276: `createOrderPaymentSessions` no longer hard-codes `provider: "netopia"` / `paymentMethod: "credit_card"` when creating a session. Sessions are now provider-agnostic by default (both `null`) so the injected starter claims the provider when it runs — correct for Stripe/Adyen/bank-transfer deployments. A deployment may opt into stamping a default via the new `provider` / `paymentMethod` options on `createOrderPaymentSessions`.
  - @voyant-travel/bookings@0.122.0

## 0.121.0

### Minor Changes

- 13fe70b: The finance module now owns the booking payment-schedule routes: new exports `createBookingScheduleAdminRoutes(options)`, `createPaymentPolicyPublicRoutes(options)`, and `generatePaymentScheduleForBooking`, with the policy cascade resolvers + operator default injected as options. Also drops two unused dev-only workspace deps (inventory, operations) that finance never imported.

  behind Finance owner paths. The old Checkout workspace packages are removed
  from the v1 branch while payment plugins, storefront SDK helpers, and the
  operator starter retarget Finance checkout interfaces.

### Patch Changes

- 0fa993c: Remove Finance runtime dependencies on Product and Availability schemas for tax
  facts and profitability/allocation labels. Finance now uses reviewed SQL
  boundary reads for those read-model lookups, keeping Product and Availability as
  dev/test-only dependencies.
- b711b04: Reject generic payment `orderId` request fields and keep legacy order references behind explicit `legacyOrderId` targets.
- 47fef18: Retarget first-party imports from the removed beta package names to their owner
  packages. Operated product UI now imports Inventory React, commercial UI imports
  Commerce React, supplier UI imports Distribution React, checkout UI imports
  Finance React, and operated place/availability schema references import
  Operations owner paths.
- 6196b3b: Move customer portal runtime and React surfaces under Storefront owner paths and
  remove the old customer-portal workspace packages. Remove the retired Checkout
  workspace packages now that Finance and Finance React own checkout collection
  services, hooks, and UI.

## 0.117.1

### Patch Changes

- b7056f1: `GET /aggregates` (admin dashboard KPIs) is now served through a read-through TTL snapshot (`readThroughAggregateSnapshot` from `@voyant-travel/db/aggregate-snapshots`, 60s TTL, keyed by endpoint + query params): the first request computes and stores, subsequent requests within the TTL are ONE indexed read instead of the full aggregate fan-out (finance alone was ~11 queries per dashboard load). Response shapes are unchanged. `Cache-Control` on these endpoints tightened from `private, max-age=60` to `private, max-age=30` (availability gains the header for the first time). Requires the `aggregate_snapshots` table from the upcoming @voyant-travel/db migration — until it is applied, endpoints transparently fall back to live computation.

## 0.117.0

### Patch Changes

- 7255353: Index pass for the hot finance read paths: `supplier_invoices` hot list/filter indexes (`supplier_id`, `(supplier_id, created_at)`, `status`, `(status, created_at)`, `due_date`) are now partial on `deleted_at IS NULL` — every supplier-invoice read path filters soft-deleted rows, so the indexes shrink and stay usable for all of those queries (same index names, definition change only). New `idx_invoices_created` on `invoices(created_at)` backs the dashboard's monthly rollups, which filter a bare `created_at` range.

### Patch Changes

- cfa6af8: feat(finance): accounts-payable supplier invoices, profitability & end-to-end FX

  Adds the full accounts-payable vertical for #1506:

  - **Supplier invoices (AP)**: `supplier_invoices` / `supplier_invoice_lines` /
    `supplier_cost_allocations`, the `supplierInvoicesService` (create/update/
    setLines/setAllocations/payments), attachments, and admin API routes.
  - **Cost allocation**: two-step product → departure picker, configurable cost
    categories (managed under Settings), searchable comboboxes.
  - **Profitability**: per-departure / per-product / per-traveller P&L read model
    - dashboards, cost-by-category breakdown, charts, CSV export.
  - **Accountant share portal**: scoped, revocable token links (no login) exposing
    financials + client/supplier invoices with downloadable attachments, ZIP
    download, and an en/ro language switcher.
  - **End-to-end FX**: supplier invoices and cost allocations snapshot their
    accounting-base value at the FX rate effective on the issue date; the
    profitability rollup sums those recorded snapshots (per-transaction-date
    rates) instead of re-valuing aggregates at the latest rate.

  Supporting additive exports: `availability`/`bookings`/`suppliers` schema and
  linkable exports consumed by the finance read model, and new TypeID prefixes in
  `schema-kit`.

## 0.82.0

### Patch Changes

- 79ce168: Slot-detail / allocation / booking-sheet UX pass.

  - `AvailabilitySlotDetailPage`: status badge color-coded by tone (open=green, closed/sold-out=red), product-type badge, locale-formatted date range with timezone chip, financial KPI cards (Remaining/Initial Pax, Total, Paid + %, Outstanding + %, per-currency rollup), timeline-style Activity tab, `<dl>`-style Metadata tab, AlertDialog delete confirmation, host-driven Edit / Open Product / Create Booking actions.
  - Slot allocation grid: side-by-side Unallocated + resources layout kicks in at `lg:` instead of `xl:`; payment-status chip palette unchanged but Tailwind source paths now cover `@voyant-travel/allocation-ui` in the operator template so the colors actually render.
  - `AvailabilitySlotsTab`: optional header / `asPanel` / `hideBulkDelete` / `bulkStatusSelect` props let hosts embed the slots table outside of a Tabs shell and replace the bulk Open/Close buttons with a single "Change status" select.
  - Allocation manifest now exposes `sellAmountCents` / `paidAmountCents` per booking (and `derivePaidAmountCents` is exported from `@voyant-travel/availability`). `productOptionSchema` adds `sellCurrency` and `productType` so consumers can drive currency / badge UI off the catalog response.
  - `GET /v1/products/:id` joins `product_types` and returns `productType` alongside the product row via new `productsService.getProductByIdWithType`.
  - `BookingCreateDialog` → `BookingCreateSheet` (file + symbol + registry slug rename). Right-side wide sheet, departure picker disables when opened with a `defaultSlotId`, full-mode payment schedule defaults the due date to the departure day until the operator touches it, payment-schedule currency falls back through product → pricing → placeholder so the server's `invalid_payment_schedules` validator stops rejecting mismatched currencies, slot-allocation cache busted after create so new bookings appear without a manual refresh.
  - `BookingQuickViewSheet`: real Payer section (email/phone/language/website/address), card-per-traveler details (email/phone/language/special-requests/notes), per-traveler document list, and a collapsible "More info" that lazily calls the audit-logged reveal endpoint to surface DOB / nationality / document / dietary / accessibility / bed preference.
  - `ProductQuickViewSheet`: new component in `@voyant-travel/products-ui` mirroring the booking quick view shape — cover image, booking/capacity mode badges, full description, dates, itinerary days (with location + description), options list with status badges, tags, "View full product" footer.
  - `AsyncCombobox` now forwards `disabled` to `ComboboxInput` so disabled comboboxes are actually uneditable.
  - `DataTable` selection checkboxes use bubble-phase `stopPropagation` (wrapped in a `<div>`) instead of `onClickCapture` — fixes the "checkbox doesn't fire" bug under base-ui's checkbox event flow.
  - `useBookingCreateMutation` consumers (sheet) invalidate `availabilityQueryKeys.slots()` after create.
  - `loadProductOptionUnits` in finance booking-create now uses the exported `toRows<T>` normalizer to handle both `drizzle-orm/postgres-js` and `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` return shapes.
  - Operator template: Availability nav item moved directly under Products; slot detail route hosts the new edit dialog, booking quick view, product quick view; Tailwind `@source` scans `@voyant-travel/allocation-ui` dist + src.
  - I18n: en/ro keys added for `tabSlots: "List"` rename, slot detail Activity timeline filters, slot Meta block, "Change status", "Create booking", "Edit slot", traveler reveal labels, booking quick view payer.

## 0.81.16

### Patch Changes

- 0a617cc: Operator-dashboard booking-detail UX polish + finance refactors.

  **Booking list & detail**

  - Bookings index hides `draft` + `expired` by default; new `excludeStatuses` filter on the bookings list endpoint + react query keys.
  - Booking-detail subtitle now shows `Billing person / Product / Dates / PAX` with clickable links to the CRM person, product, and availability slot; product title truncates at 18rem with full-text tooltip.
  - Header action menu replaced by inline outline buttons (Edit / Change status / Cancel / Delete). Delete uses a proper `AlertDialog` instead of `window.confirm`.
  - Stat-card currency layout is now `<symbol> <amount> <code>` for every currency except RON (collapses to `<amount> RON`).
  - Items table dates use the active locale (`formatDateTime` from i18n provider) and show start → end when both timestamps exist.
  - Tabs reordered: Documents now precedes Suppliers.

  **Tab refactors (Items / Travelers / Payments / Invoices / Documents / Suppliers / Payment-schedule)**

  - All seven tabs migrated off `<Card>` + raw `<table>` onto the shared `<div data-slot>` + `DataTable` + `IconActionButton` + `StatusBadge` + `AlertDialog` pattern.
  - Snapshots opened in a `<Sheet>` so operators stay on the booking page.

  **Invoices tab**

  - New `BookingInvoiceDialog` (Dialog, not Sheet) for "New Invoice": Type segmented (Invoice / Proforma), Source segmented (Schedule / Custom), schedule-driven prefill that auto-derives net unit amount, tax%, due date; manual line items with add/remove; auto-derived Subtotal/Tax/Total (always read-only); SmartBill sync toggle (defaults on); Mark as paid switch with method + date pickers; attachment uploader when sync is off; sandboxed iframe contract preview.
  - Generate-from-schedule line items now back the tax out of the gross schedule amount (no more 21% inflation on top).
  - Server omits `subtotalCents/taxCents/totalCents` cross-check when client doesn't pre-compute totals.

  **Add-contract dialog (new)**

  - `BookingContractDialog` replaces the per-row "Generate contract" button. Two modes — Generate (default, preselected) renders an iframe preview via a new `?preview=true` branch on `/v1/admin/bookings/:id/generate-contract`, and Upload (title + PDF) creates a `signed`-status contract row + attaches the file.
  - Legal `autoGenerateContractForBooking` gains a `previewMode` option that stops after rendering HTML without persisting.

  **Payment schedule**

  - Switched `PaymentScheduleValue` from fixed slots to a `installments: PaymentInstallment[]` array. Mode-switch prefills due dates between today and **one day before departure** (clamps to today when lead time ≤ 1 day) and distributes amounts evenly. Add/remove redistributes amounts so the rows always sum to the booking total.
  - New Invoice column on the schedule table links to the invoice/proforma covering each row.
  - Generate-invoice / Generate-proforma actions hide when an invoice (or proforma) already covers the row, preventing accidental duplicate documents.
  - Server-side `assertBookingPaymentScheduleHasPaymentCoverage` no longer requires session-linked payments — it sums every completed payment under the booking's invoices (with FX-equivalent amounts via `baseAmountCents`) and subtracts other schedules already paid, so manually-recorded payments can mark a schedule paid.
  - Schedule edit dialog now surfaces server validation errors inline instead of swallowing them.

  **Record payment dialog**

  - "Convert proforma to invoice" switch shown when the selected invoice is a proforma + status is Completed. Default off; auto-flips on only when the entered amount (directly or via FX) covers the invoice's remaining balance. Heuristic freezes once the operator toggles. Conversion fires post-create so a failure surfaces without rolling back the payment.
  - `useInvoicePaymentMutation` now invalidates the booking-scoped payment lists (`admin-booking-payments`) so the table refreshes after recording.

  **Proforma → invoice linkage**

  - `getInvoiceById` returns `convertedToInvoiceId` + `convertedToInvoiceNumber` (the inverse of `convertedFromInvoiceId`). The invoice sheet shows a green "Invoiced" / "Facturat" status with a deep link to the final invoice when a void proforma was converted. Converted proformas are filtered out of the invoices table on the booking detail page.

  **New booking dialog**

  - The three document-related checkboxes (Generate contract / Generate invoice / Create as draft) collapse into two mutually-exclusive options: "Generate proforma" and "Generate invoice and contract". `invoiceType` plumbs through the catalog booking-engine contract, products handler, finance service, and react hook.

  **Misc**

  - SmartBill plugin honors a new `skipExternalSync` flag on `invoice.issued` / `invoice.proforma.issued` so per-invoice opt-out from external sync is possible.
  - SmartBill rate-limit date parser now anchors `24/05/2026 09:32:48`-style timestamps to UTC instead of the JS host's local time. The instant decoded from the same response is now identical on CI (UTC) and on developer machines in non-UTC zones (e.g. Europe/Bucharest, EEST). Fixes a pre-existing test failure when running locally outside UTC.
  - Bookings list excludeStatuses filter (string-or-array) parsed by `bookingListQuerySchema`.
  - `BookingPaymentsSummary` adds an FX equivalent column with `baseCurrency` + `baseAmountCents` plumbed through `publicFinanceBookingPaymentSchema` and the operator `useAdminBookingPayments` projection.
  - Currency combobox now correctly disables (forwards `disabled` to the inner input and hides the clear button when disabled).
  - New shared primitives in `@voyant-travel/bookings-ui`: `IconActionButton` (icon button with built-in tooltip) and `StatusBadge` (semantic tone mapping for status strings) — exported from the package root.

## 0.81.0

### Minor Changes

- f35e63c: Separate inventory units (rooms, vehicles) from pricing tiers (Adult / Child / Infant) in the booking-create flow. RFC voyant-travel/voyant#1267.

  ## What changed

  ### `@voyant-travel/bookings` — new `./pricing-assignment` sub-path

  Single source of truth for traveler→option-unit mapping, transport-agnostic. The booking-create dialog (preview + submit) is the only call site today; the server-side submit validation pathway is a follow-up — but the module is now placed where that wiring is straightforward:

  ```ts
  import {
    resolveBookingDraft,
    resolveBookingExtraLines,
  } from "@voyant-travel/bookings/pricing-assignment";
  ```

  `resolveBookingDraft` distinguishes **person-priced options** (excursions — line quantities derive from travelers) from **accommodation options** (rooms — quantities stay as the operator picked them). Returns `{ quantities, travelers, travelerIndexesByUnitId }` so submit can write `booking_item_travelers` linkage.

  `resolveBookingExtraLines` normalizes per-person extras to charged traveler quantity and stamps `travelerIndexes` so each extra line gets linked to the travelers it applies to.

  A new `roomUnitAssignmentSource: "auto" | "manual" | "none"` enum on the in-memory traveler tracks operator intent declaratively (was a one-shot `useRef` ratchet). `none` = explicit "No room" survives resolver re-runs; `auto` is re-derived; `manual` is preserved while the unit is still in the current option set.

  ### Wire format additions on `BookingCreateItemLineInput` / `BookingCreateExtraLineInput`

  - `clientLineKey?: string | null` — stable client-side key the server stamps into `booking_items.metadata.bookingCreateLineKey` for post-insert lookup.
  - `travelerIndexes?: number[] | null` — indexes (into the request's `travelers` array) the item/extra applies to. Server inserts one row in the existing `booking_item_travelers` join table per (item, traveler) pair.

  `roomUnitId` on each traveler is unchanged on the wire — current dialogs keep working without modification.

  ### `@voyant-travel/finance` — orchestrator links items to travelers

  `POST /v1/bookings/create`: after travelers + items are inserted, the orchestrator looks up each item by its stamped `metadata.bookingCreateLineKey` and writes one `booking_item_travelers` row per requested traveler. Idempotent (dedupes by `(item_id, traveler_id)`), skips silently when the converter didn't produce an item for that key.

  ### `@voyant-travel/bookings-ui` — resolver-driven dialog

  - Dropped the locally-defined `pickUnitForAge` / `redistributeByAge` (moved to the assignment module in Phase 2).
  - `displayQuantities` + submit both go through `resolveBookingDraft`. `displayExtraLines` (preview) + submit extras both go through `resolveBookingExtraLines`. No more drift.
  - The submit pipeline sends `clientLineKey` + `travelerIndexes` on every item and per-person extra so the server can link them.
  - `TravelerEntry` gains `roomUnitAssignmentSource`; category/Room/person-picker handlers set it explicitly (`manual` / `none` / `auto`).
  - Dropped the one-shot hydration `useRef` from #1265 — the source enum + resolver re-derivation handle the race + "No room" disambiguation declaratively.

  ### Architecture doc

  `docs/architecture/booking-journey-architecture.md` now codifies the invariant: traveler age/pricing band, sellable option unit, room/accommodation assignment, and explicit "no room" intent are separate draft concepts; preview totals and submit payloads must be derived from the same resolver; item/extra applicability is persisted through `booking_item_travelers`, not inferred from labels or counts. This prevents future regressions of the bug class behind #1234 / #1239 / #1262.

  ## Why this shape (vs. adding columns to `booking_travelers`)

  The `booking_item_travelers` join table already existed for participant↔item linkage. Using it for unit assignment leverages a tool that was already in the codebase — no schema migration needed, and the model naturally handles cases where one traveler is linked to several items (room + per-pax extra + ...). Adding `pricing_unit_id` / `inventory_unit_id` columns directly to `booking_travelers` (the original plan in #1267 / earlier iterations of this PR) would have been a denormalization of what the join table already expresses.

  ## Backwards compatibility

  - Existing wire-format clients that send `roomUnitId` on each traveler keep working — the server still accepts it (round-trips through, no behavioral change).
  - New clients should send `pricingUnitId` semantics through `itemLines[].travelerIndexes` (the join-table model). The current dialog still uses `roomUnitId` internally; that's fine, the resolver bridges.
  - No database migration. Pre-existing `booking_item_travelers` data is unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- 6d0c8f3: Extract `withOptionalTransaction` into `@voyant-travel/db/transaction` so the soft-fallback helper that action-ledger has used since 0.62.0 can be shared by any package that needs it. Add `Module.requiresTransactionalDb` so modules whose write paths use interactive transactions declare it, and have `createApp()` assert on first request that the resolved db adapter supports `db.transaction(async (tx) => …)`. With the neon-http (edge) adapter that assertion now throws an actionable error pointing at `createServerlessDbClient` (neon-serverless / WebSocket) or `createDbClient(url, { adapter: "node" })` — instead of the cryptic "No transactions support in neon-http driver" exception thrown on first write.

## 0.63.0

### Patch Changes

- 5bff9c3: Split "Collect payment" from "Generate payment link"; fix payment-schedule create; unblock admin-shared `/pay/:sessionId` links.

  `@voyant-travel/finance-ui`

  - New `RecordBookingPaymentDialog` — bookkeeping flow for a payment that already happened (bank transfer, cash, cheque, manual card). Fetches the booking's open invoices via `useInvoices({ bookingId })`, auto-picks the only outstanding one, pre-fills amount with `balanceDueCents`. Fields: invoice picker, amount, payment date, status, method (full backend enum), reference, notes. POSTs via `useInvoicePaymentMutation`. New i18n group `recordBookingPaymentDialog` in EN + RO.
  - New `BookingInvoiceSheet` — slide-in (`@voyant-travel/ui` `Sheet`) invoice creator scoped to a single booking. Pre-fills currency / subtotal / total from the booking and snapshots `personId` / `organizationId`. Auto-generates an invoice number. Reuses the existing `invoiceDialog.*` i18n keys.

  `@voyant-travel/checkout-ui`

  - `CollectPaymentDialog` simplified: dropped the `<PaymentStep>` "pick a method" block and the `pickHold` validation — bookings are already on hold from creation, so the dialog goes straight from amount to "Generate link". Added a schedule picker above the amount input that fetches open `pending` / `due` schedules via `useBookingPaymentSchedules(bookingId)` and pre-fills the amount when a schedule is picked. Manual amount edit detaches from the picked schedule. Default title remains "Generate payment link". New i18n keys: `scheduleLabel`, `scheduleHelp`, `scheduleFullAmount` template, `scheduleTypeLabels` (deposit / installment / balance / hold / other) in EN + RO. Removed `validation.pickHold`.

  `@voyant-travel/checkout-react`

  - `useCollectPayment` no longer issues `startProvider` for the `hold` choice. Processors (Netopia) require a real billing block at provider-start time which the admin doesn't have; the customer-facing `/pay/:sessionId` lazy-start endpoint owns provider start with synthesized placeholder billing. The admin path now only creates the payment session + plan, and the link works on first customer click.

  `@voyant-travel/finance-react`

  - New canonical `paymentMethodSchema` (full 9-value backend enum: `bank_transfer`, `credit_card`, `debit_card`, `cash`, `cheque`, `wallet`, `direct_bill`, `voucher`, `other`) and `paymentStatusSchema` (with `PaymentMethod` / `PaymentStatus` type exports) — mirrors `@voyant-travel/finance/validation-shared` without dragging the server bundle into the browser.
  - `CreateInvoicePaymentInput.paymentMethod` / `status` reference the shared types (was a narrower hand-rolled union missing 4 methods).
  - `useBookingPaymentScheduleMutation` create/update fix: response schema was wrapping the already-enveloped server response, leaving every record field "undefined" to the parser and tripping a wall of Zod errors on success responses. Now uses `singleEnvelope(bookingPaymentScheduleRecordSchema)` like every other mutation hook.

  `@voyant-travel/finance`

  - `GET /v1/public/finance/payment-sessions/:sessionId` no longer requires a `payment:read` capability when the session has a `bookingId`. The session id is the bearer credential (it's an opaque TypeID in a customer-shared link), and the public projection is already redacted to fields the customer already has. Brings booking-attached sessions to parity with trip sessions, which never had this requirement.

### Patch Changes

- 819c847: Ship the composed trip admin workflow and booking extras integration.

  Admin surfaces now include trip list/detail/composer routes, catalog-backed
  trip assembly, aggregate checkout handoff, payment-link trip summaries, and
  trip-aware navigation. Booking journeys and regular booking creation can route
  operators into the composer when the customer is building a multi-component
  itinerary.

  Catalog booking draft shapes now expose richer add-on offers, and owned product
  booking handlers can price and commit selected extras. Product detail pages can
  manage extras, booking create can select extras, and finance booking creation
  persists selected extras as booking items so invoices and payment links include
  them.

  Checkout payment pages now render clearer trip summaries, flight booking UI
  supports the refined baggage/one-way behavior used by the composer, shared UI
  exports the date-time field, and i18n includes the new trip admin copy.

## 0.52.2

### Patch Changes

- 3e09123: Finance: tax-on-issue + invoice flow refresh.

  - `finance/service-issue.ts` is the new home for the invoice-issue pipeline: it computes line-level tax at issue time, snapshots the resolved tax regime onto the invoice, and emits the events expected by the SmartBill plugin.
  - `service-booking-create.ts` and `service.ts` route through the issue service so converting a booking to an invoice picks up the same tax/regime logic as a direct issue.
  - New route added to expose the tax-preview surface consumed by `useBookingTaxPreview`.
  - `useInvoiceMutation` refreshes the booking invoices/pricing caches after issue/void/refund so detail pages no longer go stale.
  - `PaymentsPage` styling and empty-state polish; new i18n strings for the issue/preview flow (EN + RO via `i18n/admin/finance`).

## 0.28.3

### Patch Changes

- 60ef432: Add a unified payments listing that joins customer and supplier payments into a single feed, and split the operator finance area into separate Invoices and Payments pages.

  `@voyant-travel/finance`:

  - New routes `GET /v1/admin/finance/payments` and `GET /v1/admin/finance/payments/:id`. The list endpoint accepts a `kind` filter (`customer` | `supplier`) plus the usual `status` / `paymentMethod` / `currency` / `invoiceId` / `bookingId` / `supplierId` / `paymentDateFrom` / `paymentDateTo` / `search` filters and `sortBy` (`amountCents` | `status` | `paymentDate` | `createdAt`) / `sortDir`. The detail endpoint dispatches by typeid prefix — `pay_*` resolves to a customer payment, `spay_*` resolves to a supplier payment. `bookingId` is applied to both branches: directly to `supplier_payments.booking_id` on the supplier side and via `invoices.booking_id` (joined as `i`) on the customer side, so a booking-scoped query no longer returns unrelated customer rows.
  - `financeService.listAllPayments(db, query)` and `financeService.getPaymentById(db, id)` return a `UnifiedPaymentRow` shape with normalized fields (`personName`, `organizationName`, `supplierName`, `invoiceNumber`, `bookingNumber`) joined in via SQL so the operator UI doesn't need follow-up lookups.
  - New exports: `UnifiedPaymentRow` (service.ts) and `paymentKindSchema` / `paymentListQuerySchema` / `paymentListSortFieldSchema` / `paymentListSortDirSchema` (validation-payments.ts).

  `@voyant-travel/finance-react`:

  - New hooks: `useAllPayments(filters)` and `usePayment(id)` plus the underlying `getAllPaymentsQueryOptions` / `getPaymentQueryOptions` query-options factories.
  - New types: `FinancePaymentKind`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListFilters`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListSortField`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListSortDir`.
  - New schemas: `paymentKindSchema`, `unifiedPaymentRecordSchema`, `allPaymentsListResponse`, `paymentSingleResponse`, plus matching `UnifiedPaymentRecord` type.
  - New invoice-payment-mutation invalidation now also invalidates `financeQueryKeys.allPayments()` so the unified feed stays in sync with single-invoice payment flows.

  `@voyant-travel/admin`:

  - Operator nav `finance` entry now points at `/finance/invoices` and exposes an `items` sub-nav with `invoices` and `payments` links, matching the new operator page split.

  `@voyant-travel/i18n`:

  - Operator nav messages add `invoices` and `payments` (en + ro).
  - Admin finance messages add `invoicesPageTitle`/`invoicesPageDescription`, `paymentsPageTitle`/`paymentsPageDescription`, `recordPayment`, `searchPaymentsPlaceholder`, `kindColumn`/`kindCustomer`/`kindSupplier`/`partyColumn`/`filtersKindLabel`/`filtersKindAll`, plus the `paymentDetail` and `recordPaymentDialog` message groups (en + ro).

## 0.26.6

### Patch Changes

- 571e340: Server-side dashboard aggregates: add `totalPax` and `upcomingDepartures.items` to `getBookingAggregates`, and `outstandingTopN` to `getFinanceAggregates` (closes #437).

  The operator dashboard previously sampled the first 100 bookings / invoices through the list endpoints and derived KPIs in the browser. With more than a handful of rows, "total pax", "upcoming departures", and "outstanding invoices" silently drifted from the truth.

  Bookings:

  - `BookingAggregates.totalPax` sums `pax` across active-status bookings in the requested range (cancelled excluded; null pax = 0).
  - `BookingAggregates.upcomingDepartures` is now `{ count, items }`. `items` is a bounded slice of soonest-departing bookings ordered by `start_date` asc, excluding cancelled and past departures. Bound via the new `upcomingLimit` query parameter (default 8, max 20).

  Finance:

  - `FinanceAggregates.outstandingTopN` returns the top-N outstanding invoices (`sent | partially_paid | overdue` with `balance_due_cents > 0`), ordered by `due_date` (nulls last), then `issue_date`, then `id`. Bound via the new `outstandingTopLimit` query parameter (default 5, max 20).

  The operator dashboard is rewired to consume these aggregates directly — KPI cards, the upcoming-departures list, and the "needs collection" panel are now exact rather than sample-derived. The dashboard also fixes a pre-existing bug where the outstanding panel summed `total_amount_cents` instead of `balance_due_cents`.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- cc3eddd: **Checkout layering: rename `payments-ui` → `checkout-ui`, add `checkout-react`, and centralise the universal payment UX on top of the existing checkout/finance stack.**

  The "payments" domain previously had a single `@voyant-travel/payments-ui` component package with no matching backend or hooks layer, while orchestration already lived in `@voyant-travel/checkout` and state in `@voyant-travel/finance`. The naming was confusing (no `payments` package to match `payments-ui`) and verticals had to hand-roll fetch calls for the admin "Collect payment" and customer landing flows. This release rationalises the stack:

  - **Renamed** `@voyant-travel/payments-ui` → `@voyant-travel/checkout-ui`. Same components (`<PaymentStep>`, `<PaymentLinkLandingPage>`) plus a new `<CollectPaymentDialog>`. Old name is gone — update imports.
  - **New** `@voyant-travel/checkout-react` package: `useInitiateCheckoutCollection`, `usePreviewCheckoutCollection`, `useCheckoutPaymentLinkConfig`, and a higher-level `useCollectPayment(bookingId)` that maps a `PaymentChoice` to the right `initiateCheckoutCollection` request body. Re-exports the public-side `usePublicPaymentSession` / `usePublicBookingPaymentOptions` from `finance-react` so consumers don't need a second import. Owns the canonical `PaymentChoice`, `PaymentStepCapabilities`, `SavedPaymentAccount` types (re-exported by `checkout-ui` for backward-compatible single-import).
  - **`createCheckoutAdminRoutes(options)`** now mounts `collection-plan`, `initiate-collection`, and `collections/bootstrap` alongside the existing `reminder-runs` route, so admin (`actor=staff`) callers don't need a hand-rolled proxy. The public surface is unchanged.
  - **`<PaymentStep>`** simplified: dropped `send_link` and `bank_transfer` from `PaymentChoice` and the corresponding capability flags. The customer's card-vs-bank-transfer decision happens on the public `/pay/:sessionId` landing page, not on the admin picker. Admin choices are now `saved_method | new_card | extra | hold`. `hold` is the universal "create a payment session and share the link" path; vertical extras (e.g. flights' "Issue on agency credit") render unchanged.
  - **`useCollectPayment`** accepts `payerLanguage`, `returnUrl`, `cancelUrl`, `notes` per call so the processor's hosted page renders in the customer's locale and lands them back on the right confirmation route. The Netopia plugin honors all four via `startProvider.payload`.
  - **`<PaymentLinkLandingPage>`** gains an `onRetry` slot. Failed/expired sessions get a `Try again` button that calls the parent's retry handler (the operator template wires it to `POST /v1/public/payment-link/:sessionId/retry`, which mints a fresh session for the same target). Also surfaces `session.notes` as a subtitle so the customer sees what they're paying for.
  - **`PublicPaymentSession`** schema (`@voyant-travel/finance/public-validation`) gains a `notes: string | null` field. The public projection passes through whatever was stored on the session at creation.
  - **Netopia callback (`@voyant-travel/plugin-netopia`)** drops the strict amount/currency-equality check. Netopia auto-converts non-RON orders to RON for processing, so an EUR session legitimately receives a RON-denominated callback — the previous check rejected every cross-currency payment as `amount_or_currency_mismatch`. Status is the trustworthy field (matches `protravel-v3`'s production handler).
  - **`NETOPIA_MODE=sandbox|live`** replaces hard-coded `NETOPIA_URL`. Defaults to sandbox. `NETOPIA_API_BASES` exports the resolved hosts; `NETOPIA_URL` is now an optional override for staging proxies.
  - **`<FlightPaymentStep>`** updated for the simpler `PaymentChoice` shape. Drops the obsolete `onRequestPaymentLink` callback (Hold IS that flow now). The flight booking shell's `paymentCapabilities` only needs `chargeSavedCard` / `newCard` now.

  Migration: imports of `@voyant-travel/payments-ui` → `@voyant-travel/checkout-ui`. If you used `paymentCapabilities.sendLink` or `bankTransfer`, drop those — they're no longer in the type. If you wired `onRequestPaymentLink`, point that callback's behavior into the `hold` choice instead.

## 0.17.0

### Patch Changes

- 66d722d: `financeService.completePaymentSession` now accepts a 4th `runtime: { eventBus? }` parameter and emits `invoice.settled` after the transaction commits when a payment is applied to an invoice. Closes a fan-out gap where plugin callbacks (Netopia and friends) had to either run a separate poller or wrap each provider callback to manually trigger `pollInvoiceSettlement`. The Netopia plugin's callback route now resolves the finance runtime from the container and threads the eventBus through `handleCallback`.

  Default callers (no runtime) remain unchanged. `pollInvoiceSettlement` continues to emit independently — no double-emit, since it goes through `createPayment`, not `completePaymentSession`.

## 0.10.0

### Patch Changes

- 29a581a: Add Postgres `CHECK` constraints across finance, bookings, and transactions schemas to enforce: if any `*_amount_cents` column is set, its companion currency column must also be set.

  Two flavours, depending on column shape:

  - **Strict XNOR** (`(currency IS NULL) = (amount IS NULL)`) — one currency to one amount: `booking_guarantees`, `booking_item_commissions`, `payments` (base).
  - **Implication** (`(amounts NULL) OR (currency NOT NULL)`) — one currency covering multiple amount columns: `bookings.base_currency`, `booking_items.cost_currency`, `offer_items.cost_currency`, `order_items.cost_currency`, `invoices.base_currency`.

  The implication form intentionally allows "currency without amount" because the currency may be pre-declared before line items roll up.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 96612b3: Bookings-create composition surface (#223) and vouchers-as-first-class (#227) — the packages on the release train all move together, so this covers the batch.

  **Atomic booking create (#263, #264, #265, #266)**

  - `POST /v1/admin/bookings/quick-create` — one-shot endpoint that converts a product, inserts travelers + payment schedules, redeems a voucher, and creates/joins a `booking_group` inside a single DB transaction. `quickCreateBooking(db, input, { userId, runtime })` service in `@voyant-travel/finance`; `useBookingQuickCreateMutation` in `@voyant-travel/bookings-react`.
  - `POST /v1/admin/bookings/dual-create` — partaj flow: two bookings + one shared-room group, also atomic. `dualCreateBooking` service, `useBookingDualCreateMutation` hook.
  - `booking.quick-created` and `booking.dual-created` events emitted post-commit when a runtime eventBus is wired.
  - `QuickBookDialog` now mounts all nine picker sections (product, departure, rooms, person, shared-room, passengers, price breakdown, voucher, payment schedule) and submits via quick-create. Post-create "Confirm & notify traveler" toggle uses the new `useBookingStatusByIdMutation` to transition the fresh booking to `confirmed` — which (when `autoConfirmAndDispatch` is on) fires the doc bundle + traveler email through the existing `booking.confirmed` subscriber.
  - Bookings fix: `productDaysRef` / `getConvertProductData` now join through `product_itineraries` to match the real products schema; the existing `POST /v1/bookings/from-product` convert path works again.

  **Vouchers as first-class financial instruments (#262, #267)**

  - One-shot data migration: `migrateVouchersFromPaymentInstruments(db, opts)` in `@voyant-travel/finance` (CLI wrapper `pnpm -F @voyant-travel/finance migrate:vouchers`, `--dry-run` supported). Idempotent; pulls code, currency, amount, expiry from legacy JSONB metadata into the new `vouchers` table.
  - `vouchers.validFrom` (start-of-validity, maps to OpenTravel `Finance.Voucher.effectiveDate`) and `vouchers.seriesCode` (batch/campaign id, maps to `Finance.Voucher.seriesCode`) columns added. Redeem guard returns `voucher_not_started` when now < validFrom; the public `validateVoucher` `not_started` branch is now reachable. `seriesCode` exposed as a list filter. Migration pulls both from legacy metadata (honouring OpenTravel's `effectiveDate` alias).

## 0.4.5

### Patch Changes

- e3f6e72: Standardize TypeID prefixes to a first-N-chars convention for better DX.

  Root entities now use the shortest unambiguous first-N chars of the entity name
  (e.g. `pers` instead of `prsn`, `org` instead of `orgn`). Child entities use a
  2-char module code plus 2-char suffix. 19 prefixes renamed in total.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 8de4602: Add optional event-bus hooks around document primitives.

  - `@voyant-travel/legal` contract document generation routes/services can now emit
    `contract.document.generated`
  - `@voyant-travel/finance` invoice document generation can emit
    `invoice.document.generated`, and settlement reconciliation can emit
    `invoice.settled`
  - `@voyant-travel/notifications` booking document sends can emit
    `booking.documents.sent`

  These stay at the primitive layer so apps can orchestrate their own document
  policies without Voyant owning the full workflow.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- e84fe0f: Add built-in PDF document adapters for legal and finance workflows.

  `@voyant-travel/utils` now exports `renderPdfDocument()` as a shared basic PDF
  renderer for rendered text content. `@voyant-travel/legal` and `@voyant-travel/finance`
  now expose bundled PDF serializers and generator helpers on top of their
  storage-backed document workflows, so apps can generate readable PDF artifacts
  without wiring a custom browser renderer for the common case.

- e84fe0f: Add a first-class invoice and proforma document generation workflow.

  - add configurable admin routes for `generate-document` and
    `regenerate-document`
  - add `createFinanceHonoModule()` so apps can mount finance with an invoice
    document generator
  - generate ready `invoice_renditions` and mark prior renditions of the same
    format as `stale`
  - expose the new document-generation schemas and route factories from the
    package entrypoint

- e84fe0f: Add first-class invoice settlement polling and reconciliation.

  - add `POST /v1/admin/finance/invoices/:id/poll-settlement` with typed polling
    and reconciliation results
  - sync provider settlement state back onto `invoice_external_refs`
  - reconcile newly observed paid amounts into completed Voyant payments without
    over-applying across multiple provider refs
  - add `createSmartbillInvoiceSettlementPoller()` in
    `@voyant-travel/plugin-smartbill`

- e84fe0f: Add a public booking payment-history route and matching React helpers so
  storefronts can read booking-scoped payments with invoice context from
  `/v1/public/finance/bookings/:bookingId/payments`.
- e84fe0f: Upgrade legal and finance template rendering to support Liquid-style control
  flow.

  - add a shared structured template renderer in `@voyant-travel/utils`
  - keep simple `{{path}}` interpolation compatibility for existing templates
  - support Liquid loops, conditionals, and filters in legal and finance
    html/markdown templates
  - support Liquid rendering inside lexical text nodes for legal and finance
    template bodies

- e84fe0f: Add storage-backed document generator helpers for legal and finance workflows.

  `@voyant-travel/legal` now exports `createStorageBackedContractDocumentGenerator()`
  and `defaultStorageBackedContractDocumentSerializer()` so rendered contract
  artifacts can be uploaded through Voyant storage providers without custom
  generator plumbing.

  `@voyant-travel/finance` now exports
  `createStorageBackedInvoiceDocumentGenerator()` and
  `defaultStorageBackedInvoiceDocumentSerializer()` for the same workflow on
  invoice/proforma renditions, with built-in support for html/json/xml artifact
  uploads and explicit opt-in for custom PDF serializers.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 8566f2d: Add a booking-scoped public finance document surface for invoice and proforma
  downloads.

  `@voyant-travel/finance` now exposes a public booking documents route that returns
  customer-safe invoice and proforma document metadata, including the best
  available rendition status and download URL when a ready rendition has a public
  or signed URL. `@voyant-travel/finance-react` now exposes matching schemas, query
  keys, query options, operations, and a `usePublicBookingDocuments` hook.

- 8566f2d: Republish the public storefront package surfaces so published tarballs match the
  current source tree. This release restores the public finance schemas needed by
  `@voyant-travel/finance-react`, publishes the public booking and product service
  exports already present in source, and ships the day/version/media product React
  exports from the package root.
