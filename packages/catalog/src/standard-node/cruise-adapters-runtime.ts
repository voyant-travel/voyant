/**
 * The ONE documented place a deployment wires external cruise adapters.
 *
 * A cruise provider must reach two planes to be fully functional, and this
 * seam registers a single `CruiseAdapter` instance into both from one place:
 *
 *   - Vertical plane — the process-global cruise registry
 *     (`registerCruiseAdapter`), resolved by `cruisePublicRoutes` /
 *     `cruiseAdminRoutes` for external detail, refresh, detach, and the
 *     external booking commit (keyed by `adapter.name`).
 *   - Catalog plane — the booking-engine `SourceAdapterRegistry`, fed via the
 *     `cruiseAdapterToSourceAdapter` shim, used by catalog content, discovery /
 *     sync, snapshot capture, and booking-engine sourced inventory (keyed by
 *     `cruise:<adapter.name>`).
 *
 * Provider-neutral by design: Voyant Connect is just one optional contributor
 * (registered into the catalog plane by `registerVoyantConnectSources` in
 * `booking-engine-runtime.ts`, then back-filled into the vertical plane here).
 * A deployment building its own connector adds its `CruiseAdapter` to
 * `configuredCruiseAdapters` below — no Connect dependency required.
 *
 * Missing config is a no-op, never a boot failure: with no custom adapter and
 * Connect unconfigured, both planes stay empty and external cruise reads return
 * a clean `adapter_not_registered` / `registry_not_configured`, not a crash.
