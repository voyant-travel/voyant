/**
 * `checkoutFinalize` saga — runs on `payment.completed` for
 * bookings created through the storefront's checkout-start path.
 *
 * Steps:
 *   1. transition_to_confirmed — flip the booking from
 *      `awaiting_payment` to `confirmed`, stamping `paidAt`. This
 *      emits `booking.confirmed` which fans out to:
 *        - legal's auto-generate-contract subscriber (if wired)
 *        - finance's auto-generate-invoice subscriber (Phase 5)
 *   2. issue_invoice — explicit fallback when finance auto-generation
 *      isn't wired. Idempotent — checks if an invoice already exists.
 *
 * Compensation: if `issue_invoice` fails after the booking is
 * already confirmed, we don't roll back to `awaiting_payment` — the
 * payment was real and the booking is real. Instead the saga leaves the
 * booking in `confirmed` and rethrows so operations can surface the failure.
 *
 * This is an in-process compensation saga. It is not a background job or
 * durable execution surface; the payment subscriber invokes it inline.
