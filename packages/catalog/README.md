# @voyant-travel/catalog

Catalog plane foundation for Voyant. The shared cross-cutting infrastructure
that Inventory, vertical modules, resale modules, and booking add-on surfaces
adopt to participate in a normalized discovery / overlay / snapshot / search
surface.

This package owns the catalog plane foundation plus semantic search primitives:
embedding providers, model compatibility helpers, hybrid/semantic search, and
cross-audience federation. Agent runtimes wrap the catalog HTTP APIs directly;
MCP packaging is application-owned.

See [`docs/architecture/catalog-architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture/catalog-architecture.md) for the full design.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @voyant-travel/catalog
```

Install `@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts` instead when you only need the pure
adapter payload types, adapter Zod schemas, field-policy contracts,
provenance, drift payloads, or content locale/overlay helpers. Use this package
when you also need Drizzle schema, Hono routes, booking-engine integration,
search services, or catalog runtime services.

## What's in the box

- **`./contract`** — `FieldPolicy` type and the eleven governance enums. The load-bearing schema decision: every field on every Catalog Item projection is declared with a row in a per-vertical policy file.
- **`./provenance`** — `Provenance` shape (`source_kind`, `source_ref`, `source_freshness`) carried by every Catalog Item projection.
- **`./overlay/schema`** — drizzle table schema for editorial overrides keyed `(entity_module, entity_id, field_path, locale, audience, market)`.
- **`./overlay/resolver`** — resolver-merge logic with full locale × audience × market fallback chain.
- **`./snapshot/schema`** — `booking_catalog_snapshot` table for immutable booking-time Catalog Item projection views.
- **`./indexer/contract`** — compatibility re-export of the engine-agnostic
  contracts now owned by `@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/indexer/contract`.
- **`./indexer/provider`** — the `catalog.indexer` runtime port used by deployment
  composition.
- **`./indexer/postgres`** — native Postgres `IndexerAdapter`, the first-party
  managed-cloud default. It keeps a rebuildable catalog projection in the
  deployment database and uses the deployment-owned resident pool. Set the
  recorded `POSTGRES_SEARCH_TEXT_STRATEGY=lakebase` and/or
  `POSTGRES_SEARCH_VECTOR_STRATEGY=lakebase` only when Lakebase Search has
  provisioned `lakebase_text` and/or `lakebase_vector`; use
  `POSTGRES_SEARCH_VECTOR_STRATEGY=pgvector` with a deployment vector dimension
  when only the `vector` extension is provisioned. Native FTS remains the
  portable lexical fallback, and `POSTGRES_SEARCH_TYPO_STRATEGY=pgtrgm` enables
  curated-term typo recovery when `pg_trgm` is provisioned.
  Its private `projectionGeneration(slice)` token changes after successful
  writes and is intended for deployment-level cache keys, not public responses.
- **`./indexer/typesense`** — native Typesense `IndexerAdapter`, retained as a
  selectable first-party provider.
- **`./indexer/postgres-provider`** — graph provider factory selected by
  `deployment.providers.search: "postgres"`.
- **`./indexer/relevance`** — shared travel relevance corpus and comparison
  harness for measuring Postgres against a selected baseline adapter.
- **`./indexer/typesense-provider`** — graph provider factory selected by
  `deployment.providers.search: "typesense"`.
- **`./search/rerank`** — Tier 2 two-stage-search orchestration helper for browse-time pricing.
- **`./drift/events`** — drift event types for upstream change detection.
- **`./events/taxonomy`** — catalog event names + visibility-filtered payload builders, emitted via `@voyant-travel/core/events` and consumed by the existing webhook pipeline.
- **`./adapter/contract`** — public source-adapter contract. Voyant Connect, third-party providers, operator-built adapters all implement this.
- **`./adapter/schemas`** — zod schemas for source-adapter runtime payloads. Use these at HTTP, queue, RPC, and adapter boundaries instead of re-declaring validators.
- **`./booking-engine`** — quote/book services plus the Hono route module that backs `@voyant-travel/catalog-react/booking-engine` and `@voyant-travel/bookings-react/journey`.

## Architectural rules

The catalog plane is a **contract**, not a polymorphic root. Vertical modules keep their own schemas and adopt this contract; they do not share a row shape. See the architecture doc for the full rationale.

- Per-vertical operational truth — separate tables per vertical.
- Shared cross-cutting infrastructure — overlay store, snapshot graph, indexer pipeline, drift events, webhooks.
- Three composition patterns — nested fields, promoted child entities, referenced CatalogEntries.
- Three variant axes on overlays — `locale`, `audience`, `market`; sparse, default deployment uses two audiences and one market.

## Search index providers

Search-engine choice is deployment configuration, not environment detection.
Set `deployment.providers.search` in `voyant.config.ts`; credentials configure
the selected provider but never select it:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@voyant-travel/framework/project"

export default defineConfig({
  deployment: {
    target: "node",
    providers: { search: "postgres" },
  },
})
```

`postgres` selects the first-party provider declared by this package. It uses
the same graph-declared Postgres resource as the application and never opens a
separate database pool from an environment variable. `typesense` remains
available and uses `TYPESENSE_HOST` plus `TYPESENSE_API_KEY`. The standard
self-hosted operator configuration uses `search: "none"` until search is
enabled.

Embedded hosts and tests can supply a custom implementation by selecting
`deployment.providers.search: "custom"` and passing either an `IndexerAdapter`
or `IndexerProvider` at the `catalog.indexer` runtime port. The direct adapter
form is useful when the host already owns the configured adapter instance:

```typescript
// voyant.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@voyant-travel/framework/project"

export default defineConfig({
  deployment: {
    target: "node",
    providers: { search: "custom" },
  },
})
```

```typescript
import { catalogIndexerProviderPort } from "@voyant-travel/catalog/indexer/provider"
import type { IndexerAdapter } from "@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/indexer/contract"
import { loadVoyantProject } from "@voyant-travel/runtime"

const indexer: IndexerAdapter = createCustomIndexer()

await loadVoyantProject({
  host: {
    runtimePorts: { [catalogIndexerProviderPort.id]: indexer },
  },
})
```

The explicit port is ignored for `none`, `typesense`, `algolia`, and every
other non-`custom` search selection. Those values remain authoritative and
resolve only their selected graph provider. With `custom`, an explicit host
port takes precedence over a graph-declared custom provider; without an
explicit port, the graph-declared custom provider resolves normally.

Algolia and other engines are external adapter packages. They implement
`IndexerAdapter` and `IndexerProvider` from
`@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/indexer/contract`, publish a graph provider
for port `catalog.indexer`, and declare a matching selection such as
`{ role: "search", value: "algolia" }` or
`{ role: "search", value: "custom" }`. The deployment admits that package and
sets the corresponding `deployment.providers.search` value; no Algolia SDK or
vendor code belongs in `@voyant-travel/catalog`.

Adapter packages should run the test-framework-neutral conformance kit from
`@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/indexer/conformance` in their own test suite:

```typescript
import { assertIndexerAdapterConformance } from "@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/indexer/conformance"
import type { IndexerProvider } from "@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/indexer/contract"

const indexerProvider: IndexerProvider = {
  create: (options) => createCustomIndexer(options),
}

await assertIndexerAdapterConformance({
  createAdapter: () => indexerProvider.create({ registries: new Map() }),
})
```

Provider-neutral maintenance uses the optional `IndexerAdapter.admin` surface
(`list`, `drop`, and `scan`). Raw Typesense collection/search maintenance APIs
are not public catalog package surface.

## Usage

The catalog plane is consumed by vertical modules; templates wire it together.

```typescript
import { defineFieldPolicy } from "@voyant-travel/catalog/contract"

export const productCatalogPolicy = defineFieldPolicy([
  {
    path: "title",
    class: "merchandisable",
    merge: "replace",
    drift: "medium",
    reindex: "entry-locale",
    snapshot: "on-book",
    query: "indexed-column",
    localized: true,
    visibility: ["staff", "customer", "partner"],
    editRole: "marketing",
    overrideFriction: "none",
    sourceFreshness: "sync",
  },
  // ...
])
```

See `docs/architecture/catalog-architecture.md` for the full contract and worked examples.

## Source-adapter runtime validation

```typescript
import { reserveRequestSchema } from "@voyant-travel/catalog/adapter/schemas"
import type { ReserveRequest } from "@voyant-travel/catalog/adapter/contract"

const request: ReserveRequest = reserveRequestSchema.parse(await req.json())
```

Reserve and cancel requests may include a `scope` matching live resolution plus
an `idempotency_key`; cancel results may return `status: "pending"` with
`pending_channel` for async upstream workflows.

External adapters that do not run the catalog package can import the same
schemas and types from `@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/adapter/schemas` and
`@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/adapter/contract`.

## BookingJourney HTTP routes

`@voyant-travel/catalog` exports `createCatalogBookingApiModule(...)` and
`createCatalogBookingRoutes(...)` for the BookingJourney server contract. The
same functions remain available from `@voyant-travel/catalog/booking-engine` for
consumers that prefer the narrower subpath. The module mounts the shared quote,
draft, hold, and book endpoints on both catalog API surfaces:

- `/v1/admin/catalog/*`
- `/v1/public/catalog/*`

Templates provide the runtime dependencies instead of the package importing
deployment code:

```typescript
import { createCatalogBookingApiModule } from "@voyant-travel/catalog"

export const catalogBookingModule = createCatalogBookingApiModule({
  resolveDb: (c) => c.get("db"),
  resolveSourceRegistry: (c) => getBookingEngineRegistryFromContext(c),
  resolveOwnedHandlers: (c) => getOwnedBookingHandlerRegistryFromContext(c),
})
```

Apps that protect public routes by default must allow
`/v1/public/catalog`. Template-specific routes such as slots, admin order
management, checkout start, and booking snapshot enrichment stay in the
template.

## Catalog search HTTP routes

`@voyant-travel/catalog` also exports `createCatalogSearchApiModule(...)`,
`createCatalogSearchRoutes(...)`, and `mountCatalogSearchRoutes(...)` for the
plain JSON catalog search endpoint used by admin and storefront UIs:

- `POST /v1/admin/catalog/search`
- `POST /v1/public/catalog/search`

The module owns audience defaults: admin search uses the runtime
`defaultScope.audience`, while public search defaults to the `customer`
projection. Deployments provide the indexer and optional semantic executor per
request:

```typescript
import {
  createCatalogSearchApiModule,
  executeSemanticSearch,
  type EmbeddingProvider,
} from "@voyant-travel/catalog"

export const catalogSearchModule = createCatalogSearchApiModule({
  resolveRuntime: (c) => buildCatalogSearchRuntime(c),
  executeSearch: ({ adapter, embeddings, slice, request }) =>
    executeSemanticSearch({
      adapter,
      embeddings: embeddings as EmbeddingProvider | undefined,
      slice,
      request,
    }),
})
```

Search defaults to hybrid mode, downgrades to keyword when no embeddings are
available, and retries semantic/hybrid execution as keyword when the semantic
path fails. Pass `fallbackToKeywordOnSearchError: false` to fail closed instead.

Storefront listing pages can request typed index-layer sorting and a compact
card projection from the public route:

```typescript
await fetch("/v1/public/catalog/search", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({
    vertical: "products",
    query: "",
    mode: "keyword",
    sort: "price-asc",
    projection: "storefront-card",
    pagination: { limit: 12 },
    facets: [{ field: "categorySlugs[]" }, { field: "departureMonths[]" }],
  }),
})
```

Supported sort values are `relevance`, `price-asc`, `price-desc`,
`departure-asc`, and `newest`. Sorts are translated by the indexer adapter to
safe indexed fields such as `priceFromAmountCents` and `nextDepartureDate`; they
are not applied after app-side hydration.

When `projection: "storefront-card"` is present, the response keeps the raw
`hits`, `total`, and engine facet counts, and also includes `cards` with the
fields storefront product grids commonly need: localized name/slug, primary
category, media URLs, price-from and offer badge data, departure aggregates,
destinations, and coordinates.
