- Updated dependencies [8bd906f]
  - @voyant-travel/types@0.109.0
  - @voyant-travel/ui@0.109.0

## 0.122.0

### Minor Changes

- 490d132: Remove the final snapshot-era managed-profile aliases from the admin and migration package surfaces. Admin hosts now consume `AdminAuthRuntime`, `getAdminApiUrl`, and `adminFetcher`; deployment migration collection is exposed as `collectDeploymentMigrationSources`.

### Patch Changes

- 490d132: Move standard first-party admin factories, package copy, slots, contributions, and icons into selected deployment graph composition.
- 490d132: Move Operator Settings and Relationships admin presentation authority into selected package graph factories.
- 490d132: Make package and project declarations the sole selected access authority, removing legacy catalog overlays and runtime synthesis.
- Updated dependencies [490d132]
  - @voyant-travel/types@0.108.1

## 0.121.0

### Minor Changes

- d771be3: Compile selected graph access catalogs, make Bookings the first package-owned access authority, and
  wire exact-pair catalog validation through runtime authorization and permission editors.
- d771be3: Add the uniform selected-admin factory context used by package-owned admin
  cutovers.

### Patch Changes

  - @voyant-travel/types@0.108.0

## 0.120.0

### Minor Changes

- a97e845: Expose the managed profile's active module set at runtime so the source-free
  admin can gate its composition by the deployment's module subset (voyant#3063).

  The managed runtime already honors a profile's `modules: [...]` subset for the
  API (`createVoyantApp({ exclude })`), but the shared, framework-version-tagged
  admin image composed _every_ `create<Module>AdminExtension()` factory
  unconditionally — so every managed operator saw the full nav even when its
  profile activated a subset, with nav entries linking to pages whose API isn't
  mounted (dead links / 404s).

  `@voyant-travel/framework`:

  - Add `resolveActiveModuleIds(project)` (`/profile`) — the resolved module `include`
    set (the same one that drives `createVoyantApp({ exclude })`) as `moduleId`s.
  - `GET /auth/bootstrap-status` now returns `modules` on `ManagedBootstrapStatus`,
    so the workspace bootstrap probe learns what's active for this deployment.

  `@voyant-travel/admin`:

  - `AdminBootstrapStatus` carries an optional `modules` module-id list the
    source-free admin filters its nav/widget composition by (fail-open when
    absent).
  - `AdminWorkspaceShell` accepts `activeModuleIds`; when provided, the packaged
    **base** nav is gated to those modules (`filterAdminNavigationByModules` /
    `OPERATOR_ADMIN_NAV_MODULE_IDS`), so a shared image's static nav (Flights,
    Finance, Legal, …) is hidden for a profile subset — not just
    extension-contributed items. Fail-open when omitted, so self-hosted starters
    are unaffected.

## 0.119.0

### Minor Changes

- 8a665f3: Complete the runtime admin route/navigation composition so a source-free host
  (no generated route module) works end to end (voyant#3044).

  - `buildAdminExtensionRoutes` now builds and attaches a layout contribution's
    nested `children` (e.g. core `/settings/*`) — previously only top-level
    contributions were created, so deep links like `/settings/channels` landed on
    not-found.
  - New `buildAdminExtensionDestinations(extensions)` derives the semantic
    destination resolver map from the registry's route bindings at runtime (the
    analogue of `voyant admin generate --destinations`), so packaged pages'
    `useAdminHref` / `useAdminNavigate` resolve instead of falling back to `#`.
  - `AdminNavigationProvider.resolvers` and `AdminWorkspaceShell.destinations`
    are now `Partial<AdminDestinationResolvers>` — honest, since the provider
    already falls back to `#` for any unbound key (resolvers needing more than
    path interpolation stay host-owned). Full maps remain assignable.

## 0.118.0

## 0.117.0

### Minor Changes

- ecdf0fc: Add the admin auth capability **port** for the managed-profile admin host
  (`ManagedProfileAdminAuthRuntime`, `AdminBootstrapStatus`, `AdminAuthMode` from
  `@voyant-travel/admin/app`) — Phase 2 of voyant#3044.

  Auth is deployment-owned: the packaged admin shell/guard never import a concrete
  auth client; a deployment supplies the port (a managed Voyant Cloud profile
  provides a Cloud-broker impl, a self-host deployment a Better Auth impl).

  `createAdminWorkspaceBeforeLoad` now takes the port (`{ auth }`) instead of a
  bare `{ getCurrentUser }`, and resolves the unauthenticated destination from it:
  `voyant-cloud` mode redirects to the Cloud identity-broker, otherwise to the
  local `signInPath` — removing the previous double-hop through the local sign-in
  page and keeping the packaged admin free of a concrete auth client.

## 0.116.0

### Minor Changes

- 62e87ee: Surface flight orders (bookings/tickets). Adds a Flights → Orders list page (`FlightOrdersPage`) and an order detail route on the packaged flights admin, so a held order — carrying a ticketing deadline — no longer disappears after the confirmation screen. Operators can review orders, filter by status/search, and from the detail view issue tickets (before the deadline) or cancel. Adds a `useFlightOrderTicket` hook and a capability-gated `POST /orders/:orderId/ticket` route to the flights module. The operator admin sidebar now expands Flights into **Search** and **Orders** sub-items (`admin` nav + `i18n` `flightsSearch` label; `flightOrders` label already existed).

## 0.113.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f92198: Voyant 1.0 visual refactor of the framework UI.

  - **Tokens** (`@voyant-travel/ui` `globals.css`): warm off-white paper, near-black ink, and a single hot-orange brand accent (`--brand`, new token) reserved for charts/focus/active state. Inter Tight type. Fixed brand chart palette (`--chart-1..5`). A coherent radius system: controls + their dropdowns at `rounded-sm` (4px), cards/table surfaces at `rounded-md` (6px), dialogs/sheets at `rounded-xl`.
  - **`@voyant-travel/ui` components**: new `SegmentedControl`; `Button` gains a `brand` variant; sharper, consistent radii across Button/Input/Select/Combobox/Textarea/Toggle/Tabs/Menus/Command/Card/DataTable/Badge; bordered active sidebar items (primary + sub) and inset-panel border; assorted fixes (Command search-input radius, toggle-group corners, sidebar sub-menu spacing).
  - **`@voyant-travel/admin`**: Voyant 1.0 brand logo lockup (composed mark + wordmark, collapse-to-badge); operator shell defaults to the inset sidebar layout; dashboard KPI cards, brand chart colors, and Figma-matched sidebar (bordered active item, near-black nav text, bordered user card with open-state).
  - **Domain `*-react` packages**: card surfaces normalized to the new `rounded-md` radius; flights search bar (trip-type toggle, route cards, airport dropdown) and the resources tabs aligned to the system.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [4f92198]
  - @voyant-travel/ui@0.107.0

## 0.112.0

### Minor Changes

- 94890c3: Add `adminExtensionsFromGlob` + `buildAdminExtensionRoutes` — the admin-UI half of the "extend without forking" seam (Workstream C). A deployment drops an `AdminExtension` (page + widget + nav, via the existing `defineAdminExtension`) into `src/admin/<name>/index.tsx` and it's auto-discovered from a Vite `import.meta.glob` and composed into the shell:

  - `adminExtensionsFromGlob(glob)` collects the default-exported `AdminExtension`s in stable order; append them to the shell's extension registry so their `navigation` and `widgets` resolve through `resolveAdminNavigation`/`resolveAdminWidgets`.
  - `buildAdminExtensionRoutes(extensions, getParentRoute, runtime)` builds top-level TanStack routes from the extensions' `routes` contributions at runtime (mirrors the generated `admin.routes.generated.tsx` loop) for grafting via `attachAdminExtensionRoutes`. Discovered pages are reachable by string navigation (no typed-link map entry).

  See `docs/architecture/custom-modules.md`.

- cb9b04b: New `defaultOperatorNavIcons` export — the standard operator nav icon set (the 15 standard lucide icons), shipped by the framework so deployments stop hand-wiring lucide imports + an icon map. Use `icons={defaultOperatorNavIcons}` directly, or spread to override a single entry (`{ ...defaultOperatorNavIcons, finance: MyIcon }`). First slice of consolidated-deployments Workstream C (admin chrome derivation).

## 0.111.5

### Patch Changes

- c38f00a: Add a default admin router pending fallback so package-owned admin apps show a loading state while route guards and loaders resolve.

## 0.111.4

### Patch Changes

- 8fd3d68: Expose AdminWorkspaceShell header slots and add the workspace.header.actions widget slot.

## 0.111.3

### Patch Changes

- ecec979: Improve operator bundle boundaries by adding route-local admin message provider support, exposing admin extension route helpers, keeping pending skeletons structural, and tightening Vite route ignores and vendor chunk splitting so heavy admin route dependencies stay out of the initial entry.

## 0.111.2

### Patch Changes

- eef1a00: Republish notification and UI consumer packages so stale beta artifacts no longer reference legacy notification package specifiers.

## 0.111.1

### Patch Changes

- dd71543: Move the packaged admin app shell into `@voyant-travel/admin/app/*` and keep
  `@voyant-travel/admin-app` as a compatibility shim over the new exports.

## 0.111.0

### Minor Changes

- 41b08db: Packaged-admin final sweep: the CORE admin pages ship from
  `@voyant-travel/admin-app` as a built-in extension, and index redirects become
  contribution-driven. The operator deleted its last 18 core route files
  (12 settings files, `/account`, the dashboard host, and the 4 domain index
  redirects) plus the superseded settings/account components.

  - `@voyant-travel/admin`: `AdminUiRouteContribution` grows `redirectTo?: string`
    (a redirect contribution counts as implemented on its own — host binders
    emit a before-load redirect, which also covers SSR) and `children?:
AdminUiRouteContribution[]` (nested child contributions under a layout
    contribution; child paths are parent-relative, `"/"` is the index). New
    `findAdminRouteContribution` does the depth-first lookup;
    `requireImplementedAdminRoute` accepts redirect contributions and
    resolves nested children.
  - `@voyant-travel/admin-app`: new `createAdminCoreExtension(options)` (exported
    from the root and `./core-extension`) — the `core` extension contributing
    `/` (the dashboard page behind a lazy chunk; hosts supply an SSR
    aggregates loader via `dashboard.loader`), `/account` (auth-react's
    packaged `AccountPage`), and the `/settings` area: a packaged layout
    (grouped sub-nav + outlet, labels resolved reactively from the operator
    admin messages) with nested children — an index redirect (default
    `/settings/channels`) and the nine built-in pages (team, API tokens,
    channels, taxes, cost categories, pricing categories, price catalogs,
    product types, product tags). Surfaces eject with `false`; built-in
    settings pages drop via `settings.omit`; app-custom settings pages splice
    in via `settings.extraPages` (the operator's Operator Profile page uses
    this). The binder gains redirect support (`beforeLoad` throwing the
    router redirect) and `adminExtensionChildRoutes(...)` for binding
    runtime-known children the generated route module cannot emit
    statically. The new domain peers (auth/distribution/finance/pricing/
    products react) are optional and only loaded by the lazy page/loader
    chunks.
  - `@voyant-travel/catalog-react` / `@voyant-travel/finance-react` /
    `@voyant-travel/legal-react` / `@voyant-travel/notifications-react`: the admin
    extensions contribute their index redirect (`/catalog` →
    `/catalog/products`, `/finance` → `/finance/invoices`, `/legal` →
    `/legal/contracts`, `/notifications` → `/notifications/templates`),
    replacing the operator's redirect route files.
  - Host typed-link merge note: extension routes now REPLACE file routes on
    key conflicts in the merged route-type maps (`Omit` before the
    intersection) — the pathless workspace layout claims `/` in the generated
    file types once the index file route is deleted, while at runtime `/` is
    the core extension's dashboard route.

## 0.110.0

### Minor Changes

- 9c909e2: Package-deliver the booking-flow admin surfaces (packaged-admin final sweep)

  - **bookings-react**: `createBookingsAdminExtension` now contributes the whole booking flow — three new route contributions alongside list/detail: `bookings-new` (`/bookings/new` owned-product picker that forwards into the unified journey; route-backed `booking.create` destination), `bookings-compose` (`/bookings/compose` legacy alias forwarding to the new `trip.create` destination), and `bookings-journey` (`/catalog/journey/$entityModule/$entityId`, the unified `BookingJourney` host with CRM-backed lead/traveler pickers, departure/units/voucher pickers, duplicate-departure warning, B2B default, and commit→`booking.detail` / cancel→`catalog.browse` navigation via semantic destinations). New exports: `bookingNewSearchSchema`, `bookingJourneySearchSchema` (+ param types) and the `BookingJourneyHost` admin module (`/admin/booking-journey-host`). Declares the `trip.create` destination key.
  - **admin**: `useAdminNavigate` accepts an optional `AdminNavigateOptions` (`{ replace?: boolean }`) third argument, forwarded to the host-injected navigate so packaged redirect pages keep route-redirect history semantics.
  - **admin-app**: the workspace shell's injected destination navigate maps `replace` onto the router's history-replace mode.

## 0.109.0

### Minor Changes

- faec538: Generated destination resolver maps (packaged-admin RFC §4.7 endgame).

  `AdminUiRouteContribution` gains `destination?: AdminDestinationKey` +
  `destinationParams?: Record<string, string>`: a route contribution now
  DECLARES which semantic destination key its path satisfies by pure param
  interpolation (e.g. `/suppliers/$id` satisfying
  `"supplier.detail": { supplierId: string }` via `{ id: "supplierId" }`).
  The eight domain packages annotate their 29 route-backed destinations, so
  `voyant admin generate --destinations` can emit the host's resolver map
  instead of the host hand-writing it — the operator's map shrank to
  `{ ...generatedAdminDestinations, ...custom }` with only seven genuinely
  custom resolvers (search-param construction, multi-route targets, and
  host-owned pages), and `voyant admin doctor` gates on drift between the
  annotations and the generated module.

## 0.108.0

### Minor Changes

- 478aa7c: Packaged-admin RFC §4.8 endgame — the code-assembled extension route tree.
  Package-delivered admin pages exist as NO per-route files in the host: the
  operator deleted ~50 thin host route files across all 10 admin domains; the
  route tree for extension routes is assembled in code from the contributions
  and grafted under the file-based workspace layout, with typed links intact.

  - `@voyant-travel/admin`: `AdminUiRouteContribution` grows `page?: () =>
Promise<AdminRoutePageModule>` — a lazy page-module loader (pages stay
    code-split, hover/intent preloading fetches the chunk ahead of
    navigation). The resolved component receives `AdminRoutePageProps`
    (`params`/`search`/`updateSearch`/`title`), dissolving the old "zero-prop
    components only" restriction — param-taking detail pages need no host
    route file. `AdminRouteLoaderContext` gains `params`. New helpers:
    `requireImplementedAdminRoute` (loud failure at module evaluation when a
    bound contribution loses its implementation) and `adminRoutePageModule`
    (adapter for zero-prop / all-optional-prop hosts).
  - `@voyant-travel/admin-app`: new binder — `adminExtensionRouteOptions(extension,
routeId, runtime)` returns router-facing route options (lazy component,
    loader bound to `{ queryClient, runtime, params }`, per-route `ssr`,
    boundaries) ready to spread into a code-based `createRoute({...})`, and
    `attachAdminExtensionRoutes(routeTree, parentRoute, routes)` grafts the
    built routes under the workspace layout idempotently (replace-by-path,
    dev-server re-evaluation safe).
  - All 10 `*-react` admin extensions now carry full route implementations:
    lazy `page` loaders (dynamic imports of the specific host modules, never
    the admin barrel), loaders moved verbatim from the operator route files
    (SSR modes preserved exactly, `data-only` included), pending skeletons,
    and search contracts. Bookings adds host-composition options
    (`indexHeaderActions`, `detailPageComponent` + exported
    `BookingDetailPageComponentProps`) so app-owned composition rides through
    the factory instead of a route file. Finance's supplier-invoices pages
    stay metadata-only (app-owned upload/supplier-picker/cross-domain search
    wiring) and remain host route files.

  Hosts bind everything in one checked-in generated module
  (`src/admin.routes.generated.tsx`): per route a `createRoute` call with the
  path literal + typed search schema, spreading the binder options, plus
  `AdminExtensionRoutesBy*` typed-link maps that `router.tsx` merges with the
  generated `FileRouteTypes` via `_addFileTypes` — `Link`/`navigate` stay
  fully typed for file routes and extension routes alike.

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- eeb23df: Packaged-admin RFC §4.8 (route assembly, increment 1) — framework half of
  `voyant admin generate --routes`:

  - `@voyant-travel/admin` exports `requireAdminRoute(extension, routeId)` (plus the
    `BindableAdminRoute` type): looks up a route contribution by id and asserts
    it carries a component, so generated thin route files fail loudly at module
    evaluation when an extension stops shipping the route they bind.
    `AdminRouteRuntime.fetcher` is narrowed to the string-URL `VoyantFetcher`
    convention every `*-react` data client uses, so host fetchers (and the
    global `fetch`) bind directly into generated loaders.
  - `@voyant-travel/core` manifest grows `admin.routes` (`AdminRoutesConfig`): the
    host route-tree directory and the runtime-import bindings (`apiUrlModule`/
    `apiUrlExport`, `fetcherModule`/`fetcherExport`) the route generator emits,
    with operator-convention defaults. Validated by `validateVoyantConfig`.

  The operator's promotions index route is now generated output of the new
  command (byte-for-byte reproducible from `@voyant-travel/promotions-ui/admin`).

## 0.106.0

### Minor Changes

- 4ade734: Semantic admin navigation destinations (packaged-admin RFC §4.7): packaged
  admin pages navigate to routes they don't own (booking journey, supplier
  detail, product editor) without importing a host route tree.

  - `@voyant-travel/admin`: new `AdminDestinations` interface (augmented by domain
    packages via `declare module "@voyant-travel/admin"`), `AdminNavigationProvider`,
    and `useAdminHref`/`useAdminNavigate`. Unresolvable keys warn once per key
    and degrade to `"#"`/no-op — never a throw in render paths.
  - `@voyant-travel/admin-app`: `AdminWorkspaceShell` accepts a `destinations`
    resolver map (`satisfies AdminDestinationResolvers` for exhaustiveness) and
    mounts the provider wired to the app router via `router.navigate({ href })`.
  - `@voyant-travel/catalog-ui`: declares the catalog destination keys
    (`bookingJourney.start`, `catalog.browse`, `catalog.detail`,
    `product.detail`, `supplier.detail`) covering every cross-route target the
    operator's catalog wrappers navigate to.

- ee5b530: Packaged-admin RFC Phase 2 pilot (#1643): packages can ship admin pages.

  - `@voyant-travel/admin`: `AdminUiRouteContribution` grows from metadata-only to
    the full route contract — optional `component`, `loader` (receives
    `{ queryClient, runtime }` with the host's baseUrl/fetcher),
    `validateSearch`, `ssr`, pending/error components, `capability`, and
    `preload`. Metadata-only contributions remain valid. New types
    `AdminRouteRuntime` and `AdminRouteLoaderContext`.
  - `@voyant-travel/promotions-ui`: first `@voyant-travel/<domain>-ui/admin` entrypoint.
    `createPromotionsAdminExtension({ label, icon, order, path })` contributes
    the nav entry AND the route implementation (PromotionsPage +
    loadPromotionsPage + SSR mode); the host supplies only label, icon, and
    runtime.

  The operator template consumes both: the local promotions extension is now a
  thin call into the package, and the promotions route file is a thin host that
  binds the package-owned page/loader to the file-based route tree (per-route
  provider removed — the shell's VoyantReactProvider already supplies the same
  context).

### Patch Changes

- cfa6af8: feat(finance): accounts-payable supplier invoices, profitability & end-to-end FX

  Adds the full accounts-payable vertical for #1506:

  - **Supplier invoices (AP)**: `supplier_invoices` / `supplier_invoice_lines` /
    `supplier_cost_allocations`, the `supplierInvoicesService` (create/update/
    setLines/setAllocations/payments), attachments, and admin API routes.
  - **Cost allocation**: two-step product → departure picker, configurable cost
    categories (managed under Settings), searchable comboboxes.
  - **Profitability**: per-departure / per-product / per-traveller P&L read model
    - dashboards, cost-by-category breakdown, charts, CSV export.
  - **Accountant share portal**: scoped, revocable token links (no login) exposing
    financials + client/supplier invoices with downloadable attachments, ZIP
    download, and an en/ro language switcher.
  - **End-to-end FX**: supplier invoices and cost allocations snapshot their
    accounting-base value at the FX rate effective on the issue date; the
    profitability rollup sums those recorded snapshots (per-transaction-date
    rates) instead of re-valuing aggregates at the latest rate.

  Supporting additive exports: `availability`/`bookings`/`suppliers` schema and
  linkable exports consumed by the finance read model, and new TypeID prefixes in
  `schema-kit`.

### Patch Changes

- 79ce168: Slot-detail / allocation / booking-sheet UX pass.

  - `AvailabilitySlotDetailPage`: status badge color-coded by tone (open=green, closed/sold-out=red), product-type badge, locale-formatted date range with timezone chip, financial KPI cards (Remaining/Initial Pax, Total, Paid + %, Outstanding + %, per-currency rollup), timeline-style Activity tab, `<dl>`-style Metadata tab, AlertDialog delete confirmation, host-driven Edit / Open Product / Create Booking actions.
  - Slot allocation grid: side-by-side Unallocated + resources layout kicks in at `lg:` instead of `xl:`; payment-status chip palette unchanged but Tailwind source paths now cover `@voyant-travel/allocation-ui` in the operator template so the colors actually render.
  - `AvailabilitySlotsTab`: optional header / `asPanel` / `hideBulkDelete` / `bulkStatusSelect` props let hosts embed the slots table outside of a Tabs shell and replace the bulk Open/Close buttons with a single "Change status" select.
  - Allocation manifest now exposes `sellAmountCents` / `paidAmountCents` per booking (and `derivePaidAmountCents` is exported from `@voyant-travel/availability`). `productOptionSchema` adds `sellCurrency` and `productType` so consumers can drive currency / badge UI off the catalog response.
  - `GET /v1/products/:id` joins `product_types` and returns `productType` alongside the product row via new `productsService.getProductByIdWithType`.
  - `BookingCreateDialog` → `BookingCreateSheet` (file + symbol + registry slug rename). Right-side wide sheet, departure picker disables when opened with a `defaultSlotId`, full-mode payment schedule defaults the due date to the departure day until the operator touches it, payment-schedule currency falls back through product → pricing → placeholder so the server's `invalid_payment_schedules` validator stops rejecting mismatched currencies, slot-allocation cache busted after create so new bookings appear without a manual refresh.
  - `BookingQuickViewSheet`: real Payer section (email/phone/language/website/address), card-per-traveler details (email/phone/language/special-requests/notes), per-traveler document list, and a collapsible "More info" that lazily calls the audit-logged reveal endpoint to surface DOB / nationality / document / dietary / accessibility / bed preference.
  - `ProductQuickViewSheet`: new component in `@voyant-travel/products-ui` mirroring the booking quick view shape — cover image, booking/capacity mode badges, full description, dates, itinerary days (with location + description), options list with status badges, tags, "View full product" footer.
  - `AsyncCombobox` now forwards `disabled` to `ComboboxInput` so disabled comboboxes are actually uneditable.
  - `DataTable` selection checkboxes use bubble-phase `stopPropagation` (wrapped in a `<div>`) instead of `onClickCapture` — fixes the "checkbox doesn't fire" bug under base-ui's checkbox event flow.
  - `useBookingCreateMutation` consumers (sheet) invalidate `availabilityQueryKeys.slots()` after create.
  - `loadProductOptionUnits` in finance booking-create now uses the exported `toRows<T>` normalizer to handle both `drizzle-orm/postgres-js` and `drizzle-orm/node-postgres` return shapes.
  - Operator template: Availability nav item moved directly under Products; slot detail route hosts the new edit dialog, booking quick view, product quick view; Tailwind `@source` scans `@voyant-travel/allocation-ui` dist + src.
  - I18n: en/ro keys added for `tabSlots: "List"` rename, slot detail Activity timeline filters, slot Meta block, "Change status", "Create booking", "Edit slot", traveler reveal labels, booking quick view payer.

### Patch Changes

- 62e4be5: Booking detail / list overhaul, part 2:

  **Activity tab**

  - Notes moved to the top, redesigned as a card grid (no more table). Add/edit via a new `BookingNoteDialog`; delete via `AlertDialog`. New backend endpoint `PATCH /v1/bookings/:id/notes/:noteId` + `bookingsService.updateNote` + `updateBookingNoteSchema` + `update` mutation on `useBookingNoteMutation`.
  - Activity timeline refactored to match the section-header pattern (no `Card` wrapper, `h2` + `Activity` icon + filter chips). Accepts `additionalEvents` + `footer` so action-ledger entries merge into the same chronological feed. New `action` filter chip surfaces only when ledger events are present.
  - Notes + activity entries now expose hydrated `authorName` / `actorName` (+ email fallback) via a server-side `LEFT JOIN auth.user` in `listNotes` / `listActivity`. UI renders name → email → id.
  - Client-side pagination on the timeline using the design-system `Pagination` / `PaginationLink` / `PaginationNext` primitives. Default page size 10, resets to page 1 on filter change.

  **Ledger tab removed** — entries flow into the unified Activity timeline via the new `useBookingActionLedgerEvents` hook (operator template), which keeps the cursor-based "Load more" pager rendered as the timeline's `footer`. `ledgerTab` slot + `tabLedger` i18n key dropped.

  **Metadata tab**

  - Tab renamed from "Meta" → "Metadata" (`tabMetadata`, value `metadata`).
  - Content redesigned as a definition-list of label-left / value-right rows surfacing booking id, booking number, status, communication language, created, updated. Uses the same `h2` + `Info` icon header as the rest.

  **Tab URL state**

  - `BookingDetailPage` accepts `activeTab` + `onTabChange` props (typed via new exported `BookingDetailTabValue`). Operator route wires these to a `tab` enum on its `validateSearch` schema. Refreshing or sharing `/bookings/:id?tab=activity` lands on the right tab.
  - Renamed `overview` tab value → `items` to match the (already-shipped) label.

  **Bookings list filters in URL**

  - New exported `BookingListFiltersState` shape. `BookingList` + `BookingsPage` accept `initialFilters?: Partial<BookingListFiltersState>` + `onFiltersChange?: (filters) => void`. Internal state collapsed into a single state object; every change emits a snapshot.
  - Operator route wires it through `validateSearch` (status, ids, dates, pax, sort, offset). URL stays clean: defaults are stripped before push, `navigate({ replace: true })` avoids history churn.
  - Bug fix: stripping `undefined` from the partial initial filters so an empty `/bookings` URL no longer clobbers the `BOOKING_STATUS_ALL` default and shows a phantom "Filters 2" badge on first land.

  **Bookings list table polish**

  - Columns reordered: `Booking # → Created → Payer → Items → Status → Total → Pax → Dates`.
  - `Sell amount` renamed to `Total`; `Start date/time` → `Dates`; `Lead` → `Payer`; search placeholder advertises what's matched (`"Search by booking #, payer, email, phone, or item…"`).
  - Backend search additionally matches item title + product-name snapshot (`exists (select 1 from booking_items …)`).
  - New compact, locale-aware `formatBookingDateRange` collapses shared month/year — `"Jun 15 – 20, 2026"` in en, `"15 – 20 iun., 2026"` in ro (uses `Intl.DateTimeFormat.formatToParts` to detect day-first order). Avoids the `Intl` `{day,year}` nonsense output by always building from named parts.
  - Primary item label includes a muted `({count} days)` tag computed from `startsAt` / `endsAt` (added to `bookingRecordItemSummarySchema` + server projection).
  - Hand-rolled prev/next pagination replaced with the design-system `Pagination` primitives (`BookingListPagination`), with ellipsis-windowed page numbers via `computePageWindow`.

  **Admin sidebar (`@voyant-travel/admin`)**

  - `DefaultOperatorAdminBrand` adds `group-data-[collapsible=icon]:justify-center` so the brand mark centres correctly when the sidebar is collapsed to icon-only.

## 0.59.0

### Minor Changes

- 48927be: Release the changes accumulated on main since 0.58.0 that landed without
  their own changesets.

  - **products / products-react / products-ui** — add `inclusionsHtml` and
    `exclusionsHtml` rich-text fields on `ProductRecord` plus the supporting
    product-form + product-detail UI (#994). Consumer test fixtures may need
    `inclusionsHtml: null, exclusionsHtml: null` added.
  - **catalog** — widen `CancelResult.status` to include `"pending"` for
    adapters that submit async cancellations (email / partner portal / batch)
    with a `pending_channel` (#991). Downstream consumers using the narrow
    `"cancelled" | "refused" | "failed"` union need to either widen their
    surface or map `"pending"` at the boundary.
  - **ui** — drop heavy passthrough re-exports from `@voyant-travel/ui/components`
    barrel: `RichTextEditor`, `chart`, `dashboard-widgets`, `phone-input`,
    and all `NotificationTemplate*` / `notification-template-dialog` /
    `notification-{deliveries,reminder-rules,reminder-runs}-page` entries.
    Import these via subpath from `@voyant-travel/ui/components/<file>` instead
    (e.g. `@voyant-travel/ui/components/rich-text-editor`). Was leaking ~600 KB
    of tiptap/prosemirror, ~390 KB of recharts, and ~200 KB of
    libphonenumber-js into every barrel consumer.
  - **admin** — drop `DashboardPage` from the `@voyant-travel/admin` barrel for
    the same reason (recharts leakage). Import from
    `@voyant-travel/admin/dashboard` instead.

## 0.55.1

### Patch Changes

- 819c847: Ship the composed trip admin workflow and booking extras integration.

  Admin surfaces now include trip list/detail/composer routes, catalog-backed
  trip assembly, aggregate checkout handoff, payment-link trip summaries, and
  trip-aware navigation. Booking journeys and regular booking creation can route
  operators into the composer when the customer is building a multi-component
  itinerary.

  Catalog booking draft shapes now expose richer add-on offers, and owned product
  booking handlers can price and commit selected extras. Product detail pages can
  manage extras, booking create can select extras, and finance booking creation
  persists selected extras as booking items so invoices and payment links include
  them.

  Checkout payment pages now render clearer trip summaries, flight booking UI
  supports the refined baggage/one-way behavior used by the composer, shared UI
  exports the date-time field, and i18n includes the new trip admin copy.

## 0.52.2

### Patch Changes

- 3e09123: Admin shell + dashboard refresh.

  - New `AdminBreadcrumbs` primitive (exported from the package root) with a context-based registry so nested layouts can contribute crumbs without prop-drilling.
  - `DashboardPage` revenue/booking charts: keep raw status keys so `ChartContainer`'s config resolves the right localized labels for both legend and tooltip, and let the chart card span the full grid width with the empty-state branch rendered consistently with the other KPI cards.
  - `OperatorAdminSidebar` cleanup: navigation items and statuses (`COMING_SOON` / `BETA`) now flow through the shared `operator-navigation` config so the sidebar, command menu, and breadcrumbs stay in sync.
  - `dashboard-query-options` exposes the bookings/finance KPI keys consumed by the new dashboard layout.

### Patch Changes

- 4a6523e: Reminder sequences UI (#488).

  New `@voyant-travel/notifications-ui` package with the reminder-sequence editing surface:

  - `<StageList />` — ordered stages per rule, with reorder + delete and an embedded channel list.
  - `<StageEditorDialog />` — anchor / window / cadence (`once` | `every_n_days` | `escalating(buckets[])`) / `maxSendsInStage` / `respectQuietHours`.
  - `<StageChannelList />` + `<StageChannelEditorDialog />` — per-stage multi-channel rows (channel, template, recipient kind, optional role).
  - `<NotificationSettingsForm />` — quiet hours / blackout dates / weekend skip / recipient daily cap / suppression window.
  - `<RemindersPreviewList />` — read-only "what would fire on this date" table with reasoning per row.
  - Full en/ro i18n with `NotificationsUiMessagesProvider`.

  Hooks added to `@voyant-travel/notifications-react`:

  - `useReminderRuleStages`, `useReminderRuleStageMutation` (create, update, delete, reorder)
  - `useReminderStageChannels`, `useReminderStageChannelMutation`
  - `useNotificationSettings`, `useNotificationSettingsMutation`
  - `useRemindersPreview`

  Operator template wires up three new routes (`/notifications/reminder-rules/:id`, `/notifications/preview`, `/notifications/settings`) and the operator nav gains Preview + Settings entries.

## 0.28.3

### Patch Changes

- 60ef432: Add a unified payments listing that joins customer and supplier payments into a single feed, and split the operator finance area into separate Invoices and Payments pages.

  `@voyant-travel/finance`:

  - New routes `GET /v1/admin/finance/payments` and `GET /v1/admin/finance/payments/:id`. The list endpoint accepts a `kind` filter (`customer` | `supplier`) plus the usual `status` / `paymentMethod` / `currency` / `invoiceId` / `bookingId` / `supplierId` / `paymentDateFrom` / `paymentDateTo` / `search` filters and `sortBy` (`amountCents` | `status` | `paymentDate` | `createdAt`) / `sortDir`. The detail endpoint dispatches by typeid prefix — `pay_*` resolves to a customer payment, `spay_*` resolves to a supplier payment. `bookingId` is applied to both branches: directly to `supplier_payments.booking_id` on the supplier side and via `invoices.booking_id` (joined as `i`) on the customer side, so a booking-scoped query no longer returns unrelated customer rows.
  - `financeService.listAllPayments(db, query)` and `financeService.getPaymentById(db, id)` return a `UnifiedPaymentRow` shape with normalized fields (`personName`, `organizationName`, `supplierName`, `invoiceNumber`, `bookingNumber`) joined in via SQL so the operator UI doesn't need follow-up lookups.
  - New exports: `UnifiedPaymentRow` (service.ts) and `paymentKindSchema` / `paymentListQuerySchema` / `paymentListSortFieldSchema` / `paymentListSortDirSchema` (validation-payments.ts).

  `@voyant-travel/finance-react`:

  - New hooks: `useAllPayments(filters)` and `usePayment(id)` plus the underlying `getAllPaymentsQueryOptions` / `getPaymentQueryOptions` query-options factories.
  - New types: `FinancePaymentKind`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListFilters`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListSortField`, `FinanceAllPaymentsListSortDir`.
  - New schemas: `paymentKindSchema`, `unifiedPaymentRecordSchema`, `allPaymentsListResponse`, `paymentSingleResponse`, plus matching `UnifiedPaymentRecord` type.
  - New invoice-payment-mutation invalidation now also invalidates `financeQueryKeys.allPayments()` so the unified feed stays in sync with single-invoice payment flows.

  `@voyant-travel/admin`:

  - Operator nav `finance` entry now points at `/finance/invoices` and exposes an `items` sub-nav with `invoices` and `payments` links, matching the new operator page split.

  `@voyant-travel/i18n`:

  - Operator nav messages add `invoices` and `payments` (en + ro).
  - Admin finance messages add `invoicesPageTitle`/`invoicesPageDescription`, `paymentsPageTitle`/`paymentsPageDescription`, `recordPayment`, `searchPaymentsPlaceholder`, `kindColumn`/`kindCustomer`/`kindSupplier`/`partyColumn`/`filtersKindLabel`/`filtersKindAll`, plus the `paymentDetail` and `recordPaymentDialog` message groups (en + ro).

### Minor Changes

- 66d722d: Published `@voyant-travel/admin` (renamed from the previously-private `@voyant-travel/voyant-admin`). The redundant scope/prefix was inconsistent with the rest of the workspace (`@voyant-travel/auth`, `@voyant-travel/crm`, …). Templates that referenced `@voyant-travel/voyant-admin` as `workspace:*` now use `@voyant-travel/admin` and resolve to the published package on scaffold.

  Includes the full publish setup: `tsconfig.build.json`, `build` / `prepack` scripts, `files: ["dist"]`, `publishConfig.exports` for all 9 subpaths (`.`, `./extensions`, `./providers/{theme,locale,query-client,admin-provider}`, `./lib/{i18n,initials}`, `./types`).
