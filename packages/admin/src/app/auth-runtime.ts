/**
 * The admin auth capability **port** for a deployment-provided admin host.
 *
 * Auth is deployment-owned: the admin surfaces (shell, guard, packaged pages)
 * never import a concrete auth client. Instead a deployment provides a
 * {@link AdminAuthRuntime}, and the packaged admin depends only on
 * this port. There are two implementations:
 *
 * - **Voyant Cloud** — a hosted identity-broker implementation. Unauthenticated
 *   visitors are redirected to the Cloud broker (`authMode: "voyant-cloud"`); no
 *   local password/login pages are shipped.
 * - **Self-host / starter** — a Better Auth impl (`authMode: "local"`) that also
 *   mounts the local `(auth)` page suite consuming this same port.
 *
 * The `getCurrentUser` / `getBootstrapStatus` members are typically TanStack
 * server functions (cookie-forwarding), so they are *provided*, not packaged.
