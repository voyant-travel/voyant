# @voyant-travel/reporting-react

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 464815c: Report export, base-currency reporting, and a redesigned builder.

  - Add report export in CSV, XLSX, and visual PDF (charts stay charts; only table
    widgets render as tables) via a new `GET /reports/:id/export` route and a
    client-side visual PDF composer.
  - Remove report versioning (versions/runs routes, tables, and retention): the
    editable draft is the single source of truth. Reporting datasets now expose a
    `defaultDateField` so the page date window applies without a per-report knob.
  - Add a `reportCurrency=base` execution mode: Finance receivables consolidate
    every amount into the operator base currency using the recording-time FX
    snapshot (`base_*_cents`), so a report can show one cross-currency total. The
    query language gains `between` and `in (...)` operators and a typed
    `ReportDatasetQueryError`.
  - Redesign the reporting-react builder to match the admin aesthetic: page date
    window, base-currency toggle, export menu, widget-preview and configuration
    Sheets, a CodeMirror query editor for custom widgets, and a silent autosave
    with an unsaved-changes guard.
  - Fix the Bookings/Finance reporting time-grain grouping (literal `date_trunc`
    grain) that previously errored under `group by`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- b8b25b7: Connect the generic reporting-react grid to `@voyant-travel/reporting-contracts` and the operator admin app as a cohesive `/reporting` vertical slice: an instance-aware `ReportDraft` model (widget instance id distinct from preset/definition id, full-draft persistence), a revision-guarded autosave document controller with optimistic-conflict resolution, the `/reporting` admin extension (list, create, instantiate-template, open; view/edit toggle; preset + custom-widget catalog; grid editing), a bounded custom-widget query editor over `/queries/parse` and `/queries/preview`, and generic KPI/table/line/bar/pie renderers. The `@voyant-travel/reporting` manifest now declares an admin runtime pointing at `@voyant-travel/reporting-react/admin`, and Reporting is selected in operator-standard.
- b8b25b7: Add the React reporting builder vertical slice (`@voyant-travel/reporting-react`)
  with explicit view and edit modes. View renders only available widgets with no
  authoring handles; edit adds a widget catalog, a 12-column constrained grid, and
  a configuration inspector with drag-by-header, resize, and add/remove.
  Unavailable widgets appear only in edit mode as removable placeholders. Layout
  is stored library-neutrally and driven through a Voyant-owned wrapper over
  `react-grid-layout`, with a deterministic single-column narrow projection, a
  keyboard-accessible move/resize fallback, reduced-motion support, and an
  optimistic local draft with debounced autosave through a typed persistence
  adapter.
