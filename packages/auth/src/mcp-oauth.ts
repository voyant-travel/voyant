/**
 * OAuth 2.1 authorization server for MCP connectors (ADR: agent tool library
 * and MCP).
 *
 * Chat assistants — Claude, ChatGPT — add a remote MCP server by URL alone.
 * They have nowhere to paste an API token, so they follow the MCP
 * authorization spec instead: hit the resource unauthenticated, read the
 * `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, fetch protected-resource metadata, discover
 * this authorization server, register themselves (RFC 7591), and send the
 * operator through a browser consent flow. This module is the Voyant-specific
 * configuration of that server; the protocol itself is
 * `@better-auth/oauth-provider`.
 *
 * The grant is deliberately coarse — `mcp:read` and optionally `mcp:write` —
 * because a non-technical operator cannot reason about fifty resource scopes on
 * a consent screen. The fine-grained permissions are derived at request time
 * from the approving staff member (see {@link resolveMcpGrantScopes}), so a
 * connector can never exceed the person who connected it, and it loses access
 * the moment their role is narrowed.
