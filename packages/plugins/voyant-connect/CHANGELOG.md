## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 1205cf7: `listVoyantConnectSourceConnections` no longer issues a redundant per-connection
  `get()` to enrich each row. `connections.list` already returns the full
  `ConnectionSummary` (`id`/`status`/`providerKey`/`supplierName`) — the same shape
  `get` returns — so enumeration is now a single round-trip instead of `1 + N`,
  shedding N requests against the Connect control plane per warm. No behavior or
  API change.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- dd463c1: `prepareVoyantConnectSources` can now build enumerate-path sources without a
  network connection enumeration, and threads cruise read memoization through both
  planes (#94):
  - `connections` — pass a pre-fetched connection list to skip the `list()` call.
  - `connectionCache` — a read-through `{ get, set }` hook (e.g. backed by Workers
    KV) so a cold isolate can reuse the serializable connection list.
  - `cruise` — forwarded to both the default and per-connection sources, so
    `cruise.memoize` wraps cruise reads consistently across both.

  All additive; existing callers are unaffected.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- 0130564: Relicense the public Connect packages from `FSL-1.1-Apache-2.0` to `Apache-2.0`.
  The root `LICENSE` is replaced with the standard Apache License 2.0 text.
- Updated dependencies [0130564]
  - @voyant-travel/connect-sdk@0.9.1
  - @voyant-travel/connect-adapter@0.3.2
  - @voyant-travel/connect-cruises@0.6.1

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 8ebf113: Move `@voyant-travel/plugin-voyant-connect` into the Connect repo alongside the
  other public Connect packages. It now consumes `@voyant-travel/connect-sdk`,
  `@voyant-travel/connect-adapter`, and `@voyant-travel/connect-cruises` from the
  workspace, and declares `@voyant-travel/catalog`, `@voyant-travel/cruises`, and
  `@voyant-travel/data-sdk` as peer dependencies provided by the host deployment.

  Because `connect-cruises` now returns vertical-conformant ship shapes, the
  internal `conformConnectCruiseAdapter` bridge and the `as CruiseAdapter` cast in
  the cruise source are removed — `createConnectCruiseAdapter` is used directly.
