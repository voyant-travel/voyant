# @voyant-travel/bookings-contracts

## 0.107.0

### Minor Changes

- ba6c30a: Add a vertical enrichment seam to the public guest-booking overview so
  storefront "manage my booking" / confirmation surfaces can render
  accommodation specifics from the public API alone (issue #2969).

  Deployments can register a per-`booking_item_type` enricher via the new
  `overviewItemEnrichers` option on the bookings route runtime. Each enricher
  receives the overview items of its type and returns an opaque `details`
  block that is attached to the matching overview item, keyed by booking item
  id. Enrichment is best-effort — a failing enricher is skipped rather than
  failing the guest-authorized overview.

  `@voyant-travel/accommodations` ships the first enricher
  (`enrichStayBookingOverviewItems`, exported from
  `@voyant-travel/accommodations/booking-overview-enricher`), contributing
  property, room type, rate plan, meal plan and per-night rate details. The
  framework composition wires it to the `accommodation` item type.

## 0.106.0

### Minor Changes

- 04681f3: Adopt custom fields on `booking` — the first entity consumer of the `@voyant-travel/core/custom-fields` registry.

  - A `custom_fields jsonb default '{}'` column on `bookings` (framework bundle migration `0001`).
  - Booking create/update routes validate the `customFields` payload at the boundary against the deployment's injected registry (`validateBookingCustomFields`): unknown keys, missing required, and wrong types are rejected 400; only registry-approved values are persisted. Writes that carry `customFields` when the deployment declares none are rejected.
  - The registry is injected through `BookingRouteRuntimeOptions.customFields` → `createBookingsHonoModule` → a new optional `FrameworkProviders.customFields` provider, which a deployment supplies (the operator wires its discovered `operatorCustomFields`).

  Read paths return `custom_fields` as part of the booking row. Oracle-verified (`bundle + links == live schema`). Per-entity adoption continues with `person`/`product`; export/invoice/search consumption of `customFieldsVisibleIn` is a follow-up. See `docs/architecture/custom-fields.md`.

## 0.105.0

### Minor Changes

- 2c9c4a4: Retire the runtime Transactions packages before v1. The default Bookings/OCTO
  bridge now reads booking origin/provenance records instead of the legacy
  booking-to-transaction detail table, and the public `@voyant-travel/transactions`
  and `@voyant-travel/transactions-react` workspaces have been removed. The
  legacy `@voyant-travel/transactions-contracts` workspace is removed as well;
  use the owning domain contract/runtime package for replacement validation
  schemas.

### Minor Changes

- 7094c8e: Add `@voyant-travel/schema-kit` and extend the `*-contracts` pattern to the
  operational modules.

  `@voyant-travel/schema-kit` (pure: zod + typeid-js) is the new foundational home for
  schema primitives shared by the runtime and the contract packages — the TypeID
  system (prefix registry, id generation, zod validators), `booleanQueryParam`,
  and `kmsEnvelopeSchema`. These moved out of `@voyant-travel/db` (which now re-exports
  them from their original paths, so every call-site is unchanged) so they sit
  below the data layer and the contract packages can depend on them without
  pulling Drizzle.

  New zod-only contract packages own each module's validation surface (schemas +
  enums): `@voyant-travel/bookings-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/finance-contracts`,
  `@voyant-travel/crm-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/transactions-contracts`,
  `@voyant-travel/suppliers-contracts`, `@voyant-travel/identity-contracts`, and
  `@voyant-travel/legal-contracts`. Each runtime module re-exports from its contracts
  package, so existing `@voyant-travel/<module>/validation` import paths are unchanged.
  Shared primitives come from `@voyant-travel/schema-kit`, keeping the contract
  packages free of the data layer.

  (`legal-contracts` still transitively depends on `@voyant-travel/utils` for the
  template-syntax validator used by contract validation — a tracked follow-up
  would purify it.)
