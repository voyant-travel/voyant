/**
 * The `@voyant-travel/operator-settings` ApiModule — the standard settings
 * surface mounted by `@voyant-travel/framework`'s composition. Routes live at
 * stable absolute paths, so the module uses `lazyRoutes` (explicit matchers +
 * a lazily-imported route bundle, cached per isolate).
 *
 * The loaded bundle is an `OpenAPIHono` (carrying the `defaultHook` that shapes
 * request-validation failures) so its `createRoute(...).openapi(...)` operations
 * are visible to the build-time `mergeLazyOpenApiPaths` replay (voyant#2114).
 *
 * `createOperatorSettingsVoyantRuntime` is the graph-runtime-factory the module
 * declares as its top-level runtime: it resolves the optional managed payment
 * registry port and, when a deployment provides it, registers the resolver into
 * the module container so the Settings → Payments routes broker to the control
 * plane (self-host uses the default registry). See voyant
 * `docs/adr/0015-payment-adapter-transports-and-managed-connect.md`.
