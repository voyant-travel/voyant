### Minor Changes

- 46d00dc: Retire the storefront entity: the key becomes the unit, customer accounts move to the deployment.

  A deployment IS the tenant boundary (ADR-0001), so it serves one set of surfaces, and
  the only scenario that justified N storefront rows — several brands inside one tenant —
  is explicitly not happening. What the row carried splits between the two things that
  genuinely vary: the **key** (allowed origins, channel, cookie scope) and the
  **deployment** (customer-auth methods, buyer-account policy, OAuth credentials).

  **Breaking:**

  - `storefronts`, `storefront_api_keys` and `storefront_customer_auth_credentials` are
    dropped, replaced by `public_api_keys`, `customer_account_settings` (a singleton) and
    `customer_account_credentials`. Key ids are copied verbatim — a key's identity is what
    an operator has already recorded elsewhere, so nothing is rotated by a rename.
  - `storefrontRuntimePort` → `publicApiRuntimePort`, with the DTOs and the local adapter
    reshaped onto the key. The storefront→channel link table and its provider are gone:
    a key names a channel or defaults to Direct.
  - `/v1/admin/storefronts` splits into `/v1/admin/public-api-keys` (keys) and
    `/v1/admin/customer-accounts` (sign-in methods, buyer policy, provider credentials),
    with separate access resources so the two are separately grantable. Revoking a key now
    requires `public-api-keys:delete` rather than `:write`.
  - The `storefront` packages are renamed: `@voyant-travel/storefront` →
    `@voyant-travel/public-api`, `-react` → `@voyant-travel/public-api-react`, `-sdk` →
    `@voyant-travel/public-api-client`. All three are `private: true` with in-repo
    consumers only, so there is no npm surface to deprecate. Its admin API moves from
    `/v1/admin/storefront` to `/v1/admin/public-api`, its `openapi/storefront/*` documents
    to `openapi/public-api/*`, and its capability `storefront.data-owner` to
    `public-api.data-owner`.
  - **Scope rename:** `storefront:read|write` → `public-api:read|write` on the composed
    public surface (offers and customer intake). The key-management resource introduced
    above is `public-api-keys:*`, kept distinct because the two govern different things
    and would otherwise collide on one name.
  - The BFF origin header is renamed `x-voyant-storefront-origin` → `x-voyant-public-origin`.
    Both spellings are NOT accepted: a second accepted spelling on a security-relevant
    header is a second thing to get wrong.
  - Trips and Bookings scope rebinds from `(storefrontId, channelId)` to `channelId` alone.
    Live capabilities and opaque shopping references keep working — the digests are
    unchanged and the surviving half of each check still matches.
  - Error codes `active_storefront_channel_required` → `active_channel_required` and
    `booking_storefront_origin_mismatch` → `booking_channel_mismatch`; the
    `bookingInquiryCreated` event payload drops its required `storefrontId`.
  - `@voyant-travel/distribution/setup/storefront-channel-bindings` is removed. It raised
    on a missing `storefronts` table, so it could only fail after this change.

  Two frontends declaring the same origin is now the ordinary case (a site's publishable
  key and its BFF's secret key), so the cross-storefront origin-overlap ban is gone.
  Keyless CORS preflight instead requires that the matching keys agree on a channel, and
  denies rather than throwing when they do not.

  **Tables renamed:** `trip_storefront_access` → `trip_public_access`,
  `trip_storefront_booking_operations` → `trip_public_booking_operations`, and
  `storefront_verification_challenges` → `customer_verification_challenges` (verification is
  the deployment's, so it sits beside `customer_account_settings`). Pure `ALTER TABLE
RENAME` — rows, keys and indexes survive, and live capabilities keep resolving.

  Note that Postgres does NOT rename constraint-backed indexes with their table, and Drizzle
  derives those names FROM the table. The primary keys and the `capability_digest` unique
  constraint are therefore renamed explicitly in the same migration; splitting them would
  leave an upgraded database disagreeing with a fresh replay, which is exactly what
  `verify:migration-replay-parity` compares.

  **Identifiers:** 351 distinct `Storefront*`/`storefront*` identifiers (3292 occurrences
  across 195 files) become `PublicApi*`/`publicApi*`. The rename is anchored on a following
  uppercase letter, so it can only match camelCase/PascalCase identifiers and cannot touch
  snake_case wire codes (`storefront_shopping_unavailable`), graph port ids, or bare
  literals. Graph port ids move separately and deliberately: `storefront.*` →
  `public-api.*`, and `trips.storefront-offer-resolver.runtime` →
  `trips.public-offer-resolver.runtime`.

  **Published OpenAPI:** every `/v1/public/*` operation was stamped
  `x-voyant-surface: "storefront"`; it is now `"public-api"`, across 17 documents.
  `ApiSurface` and `OperatorOpenApiDocuments` change with it — the latter's
  `storefront` key becomes `"public-api"`.

  The verification routes move with their mount: `/v1/public/storefront-verification/*` →
  `/v1/public/customer-verification/*`.

  **Filenames and constants:** 39 source files carrying `storefront` in their
  basename are renamed with their contents — `auth/src/storefront-credentials.ts`
  → `public-api-credentials.ts`, `trips/src/storefront-access.ts` →
  `public-api-access.ts`, and so on. Six subpath exports move with them
  (`@voyant-travel/auth/storefront-credentials`,
  `@voyant-travel/flights/storefront-booking-lifecycle`,
  `@voyant-travel/relationships-contracts/storefront-intake`,
  `@voyant-travel/trips/storefront-trip-offer-resolver-port`,
  `.../storefront-trip-selections-runtime`, and
  `@voyant-travel/types/storefront-key-scopes`). All six packages are `private`,
  so there is no npm surface to deprecate.

  A further 12 `STOREFRONT_*` constants become `PUBLIC_API_*`. The earlier
  identifier sweep anchored on a following uppercase LETTER, so SCREAMING_SNAKE
  names — where the next character is an underscore — were never matched. Their
  VALUES are untouched; none of them contained the retired name.

  Three exceptions, each because the name is data rather than a name:

  - `env.STOREFRONT_BANK_BENEFICIARY|_IBAN|_NAME` stay. They are already legacy
    fallbacks behind `BANK_TRANSFER_*`, so renaming them would drop the setting
    of exactly the deployments they exist to serve.
  - `"storefront-trip-booking-v1"` stays. It is a version token hashed into the
    operation digest recorded in `trip_public_booking_operations`; renaming it
    changes every digest, so an in-flight idempotent retry would stop matching
    its own recorded operation and book twice.
  - Migration filenames stay. A migration's name is its ledger identity.

  `PUBLIC_API_KEY_HEADER` had been written independently in `@voyant-travel/core`
  and `@voyant-travel/auth`, both as `"x-api-key"`. Auth now re-exports core's
  rather than declaring a second copy.

  **Environment:** `VOYANT_STOREFRONT_CHANNEL_ID` → `VOYANT_PUBLIC_API_CHANNEL_ID`. This one
  IS still read under its old name, which is a deliberate exception to the no-dual-spelling
  rule used for the request headers: an unset channel now resolves to the deployment's Direct
  channel, so a deployment that had pinned another channel would quietly re-route its sales
  rather than fail loudly. `VOYANT_STOREFRONT_ORIGIN` is documentation-only and simply becomes
  `VOYANT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.

  ADRs under `docs/adr/` are deliberately NOT rewritten — they record what was decided at
  the time, and this retirement is itself now part of that record.

### Minor Changes

- ef8871d: Validate the selection against the published Booking Requirements.

  Requirements reached the host in the earlier phases of #4188 but stayed
  advisory: nothing checked that the selection a host collected answered the
  descriptor the server published. A host that rendered the wrong field set did
  not error — it collected a plausible-looking set and failed at commit, or
  committed something incomplete. That is the #4113 class of bug.

  `validateSelectionAgainstRequirements(requirements, selection)` is the one
  validator, in `@voyant-travel/catalog-contracts/booking-engine/requirements-validation`.
  It walks what the descriptor declares — pax band windows and cross-band
  dependencies, required configure sub-steps, required traveler and booking
  fields — and returns machine-readable `{ requirementKey, reason }` entries, never
  prose. The Booking Session calls it at quote time so a host learns what is
  missing while it can still fix it, and again at commit because the server never
  trusts that the client quoted first.

  A Quote now carries `requirementsFingerprint` alongside `priceFingerprint`,
  computed the same way. `commitBookingSessionV1` requires the client to echo the
  fingerprint it rendered against, and the commit path re-derives and compares
  exactly as `price_changed` does. Two new recoverable outcomes on
  `bookingSessionLifecycleErrorV1`: `selection_incomplete` (with the unsatisfied
  list, `update_selection`) and `requirements_changed` (`request_fresh_quote`).
  No Booking, Allocation, or supplier operation is created when either fires.

  The lifecycle conformance suite holds third-party verticals to the same
  contract: a satisfying selection must commit on an otherwise clear path, an
  unsatisfying one must produce no side effects, and every entry a descriptor
  marks required must be something the validator actually checks.

  Migration `20260804190000_booking_session_quote_requirements_fingerprint`
  expires in-flight Quotes rather than backfilling a fingerprint no descriptor
  produced.

### Minor Changes

- 17f1239: Replace the inline Finance booking-create HTTP and dual-create surfaces with one
  handler-admitted, idempotent created-target Tool command. Booking rows, dependent
  finance records, the canonical action-ledger result, and domain-event outbox
  entries now settle in one transaction; exact retries resolve the original booking.

  Remove the retired booking-create React mutation, sheet, page, and slot shortcut.
  Unmount the legacy admin new/journey routes and semantic destinations, remove
  catalog and inventory booking actions, and remove the standard storefront
  `/shop/book/:entityModule/:entityId` route plus its booking page/journey exports.
  Catalog browsing, booking read/detail, customer-portal sessions, and reusable
  draft sections remain available; new booking creation is a Finance staff Tool.
  Remove raw Bookings, Charter, and Cruise creation APIs and Tools. Delete the
  dormant Catalog owned-commit contract and Inventory, Accommodations, Cruises,
  Commerce, Storefront, and Storefront SDK booking-row creation bridges rather
  than retaining unavailable legacy mutations. Require registry-minted,
  unforgeable handler admission plus a single-use Finance-specific mutation lease
  for Bookings domain settlement, and remove the Finance command's public
  subpath.

### Minor Changes

- ecf1680: Remove the redundant singular storefront branding admin surface and make the
  organization (operator) profile the single home for org brand identity.

  Storefronts are plural (many per org, managed under the top-level "Storefronts"
  surface). The leftover singular "storefront" Settings page edited a separate
  branding blob (logo/favicon/brand mark/colors/languages) that duplicated brand
  identity already modeled on the operator profile. Per-storefront visuals are a
  developer's frontend concern, not an admin one, so the surface and its storage
  schema are dropped.

  - storefront: drop the module `admin` block (branding settings page + branding
    setup step) and remove the `branding` shape from the storefront settings
    schema, service, admin/public routes, and OpenAPI documents. No database
    migration is required — storefront branding was never persisted to a table;
    it lived only in static deployment settings.
  - storefront-react / storefront-sdk: remove `createSelectedStorefrontAdminExtension`,
    the storefront settings page/form, and the `./admin`, `./ui`, and
    `./components/storefront-settings-page` package exports. `StorefrontSettingsRecord`
    and the settings schemas no longer carry `branding`.
  - operator-settings-react / i18n / legal: rename the user-facing "Operator
    profile" label to "Organization" ("Organizație" in Romanian) across the
    settings nav, page title, saved-toast copy, and contract template-authoring
    descriptions. The API path, `operator_profile` table, ids, and query keys are
    unchanged.
