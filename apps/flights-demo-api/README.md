# `flights-demo-api`

Standalone HTTP service that mocks a flight supplier/GDS provider so starters
and examples can exercise the full flight booking flow without external
credentials. This is a demo/reference supplier-integration surface, not an
airline or flight-operator deployment. Mirrors `FlightConnectorAdapter` 1:1 over REST; the
`@voyant-travel/plugin-flights-demo` package is a thin fetch client that
implements the adapter interface against this service.

Owns its own Postgres database — orders persist here, not in the
starter's primary DB. Replace it with a real GDS connector by swapping
the plugin, no starter tables to drop.

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # default points at the docker-compose Postgres
docker compose up -d        # spins up Postgres on :5435
pnpm db:migrate             # creates demo_flight_orders
pnpm dev                    # listens on :3320 by default
```

From the repository root or the packaged operator starter root, the equivalent
commands are:

```bash
cp apps/flights-demo-api/.env.example apps/flights-demo-api/.env
docker compose -f apps/flights-demo-api/docker-compose.yml up -d
pnpm --dir apps/flights-demo-api install
pnpm --dir apps/flights-demo-api db:migrate
pnpm --dir apps/flights-demo-api dev
```

Then in your starter (e.g. `starters/operator/.env` in the repository, or
`.env` in a packaged starter):

```
FLIGHTS_DEMO_API_URL=http://localhost:3320
```

The service fails fast on startup if its Postgres isn't reachable, so a
missing or misconfigured `FLIGHTS_DEMO_DATABASE_URL` surfaces immediately
rather than at first request.
