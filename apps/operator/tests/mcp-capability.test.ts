/**
 * MCP capability eval — can an agent do a travel agent's job? (voyant#3921)
 *
 * Everything else in this repo tests the MCP surface against a seeded in-memory
 * registry. That proves the transport and the projections, and it proved nothing
 * about whether the product WORKS: the first run of this file against the real
 * graph found that an agent could not add or find a client, because the surface
 * only answered to "person" and a travel agent says "client".
 *
 * So this is the proper instrument. Real selected graph, real MCP transport over
 * JSON-RPC, real database, real model choosing every call. It scores COMPLETION —
 * whether the work got done — and treats tokens and call counts as secondary,
 * because a cheap surface that cannot book a trip is worthless.
 *
 * Opt-in twice over: it needs TEST_DATABASE_URL and an OpenAI key, and skips
 * without either. It WRITES (that is the point), so point TEST_DATABASE_URL at a
 * disposable database.
 *
 * KNOWN REMAINING WORK — the idempotency sweep.
 *
 * Five creates now derive their key server-side and declare
 * `resolvesIdempotencyKeyServerSide` (person, product, option, unit, departure).
 * Roughly seventy tools still advertise a caller-facing `idempotencyKey`.
 *
 * That is NOT a blind sweep. Many are amendments and approvals where the caller
 * legitimately correlates a retry against an exact prior command, and stripping
 * the key there would break the guarantee it exists for. Each site needs the
 * judgement "does the handler own this command, or does the caller?".
 *
 * A chokepoint fix was tried and reverted: deriving inside
 * `executeInventoryGeneratedChild` would cover all four inventory children at
 * once, but `withServerResolvedIdempotencyKey` asserts the admission is
 * authentically minted, and the generated-children unit fixtures pass plain
 * objects. That assertion is correct and stricter than what came before, so the
 * fixtures need minting first — do that before retrying the chokepoint.
 *
 * READING THE PASS RATES. The journeys are chained, so a downstream rate is
 * CAPPED by its upstream one: if product-option-create leaves no bookable unit on
 * an attempt, booking-create on that same attempt is correctly refused, and
 * invoice-issue after it has no booking to invoice. A 0/3 on booking-create
 * therefore does not mean booking is broken — it usually means the setup ahead of
 * it failed. Read the chain top-down and fix the first link that is not 3/3;
 * today that is product-option-create.
 *
 * The journeys are chained on purpose — the person must exist before the booking,
 * the product before the departure — because that dependency is exactly what an
 * endpoint-shaped surface makes hard and what #3921 is trying to fix.
