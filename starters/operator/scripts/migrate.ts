/**
 * Deployment migration runner — D.2 package-owned migrations + topological
 * collector (`@voyant-travel/framework-migrations`). Each schema-owning package
 * SHIPS its own drizzle `migrations/` folder; this runner discovers them from
 * the same generated list `drizzle.config.ts` consumes
 * (`drizzle.schemas.generated.ts` ← `voyant.config.ts`), orders them deps-first
 * by `voyant.requiresSchemas`, and applies:
 *
 *   1. each package source (topological order — a package's deps migrate first)
 *   2. this deployment's own `./migrations` (cross-module link tables + any
 *      custom `src/{modules,extensions}` schema) LAST — they FK into package tables
 *
 * recording each in the `drizzle._voyant_migrations` ledger keyed by
 * `(source, tag, content_hash)`. The retired framework bundle is NO LONGER a
 * source; any `framework/*` ledger rows are left untouched as inert history.
 *
 * Two paths, auto-detected (see {@link runDeploymentMigrations}):
 *   • FRESH    — execute every source.
 *   • EXISTING — a pre-D.2 DB whose schema D.1's bundle or the legacy runner
 *                already materialised: import-baseline the cutline (record
 *                without executing, gated by a parity check), execute increments.
 *
 * See docs/architecture/migration-collector-d2.md.
