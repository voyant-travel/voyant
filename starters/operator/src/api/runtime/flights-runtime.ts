/**
 * Operator (deployment) wiring for the flights module.

 * The flight admin routes — and the flight→payment-session mapping — live in

 * lives in `@voyant-travel/finance`. This file only supplies the
 * deployment-specific choices:
 *   - which connector adapter to use (the demo connector for now),
 *   - which card provider starts the hosted payment (this deployment: Netopia).
 *
 * Swapping to a real GDS connector, or a different payment provider, is a change
 * here — never in the route or session implementations.
