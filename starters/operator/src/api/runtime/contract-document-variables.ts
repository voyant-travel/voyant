/**
 * Deployment glue for the contract template variable bindings.
 *
 * The variable-assembly logic (acceptance marker, payment schedule, rooms
 * summary, customer hydration, source mapping, documents base URL) is framework
 * (legal) domain logic and lives in `@voyant-travel/legal/contract-variables`.
 * This file only supplies the genuinely deployment-specific reads — the
 * operator profile + payment instructions (operator-owned settings tables) and
 * the payment-policy source (the operator's policy cascade) — plus the env
 * bindings passthrough.
