/**
 * Draft reaper — Cloudflare Workers cron entrypoint that drops
 * expired `booking_drafts` rows (per booking-journey-architecture
 * §5.7).
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   1. List drafts past `expires_at` that haven't been consumed.
 *   2. For each draft with an active hold, ask the appropriate
 *      handler/adapter to release it (best-effort; failures get
 *      logged but don't block the delete).
 *   3. Delete the draft row.
 *
 * Cadence: hourly at :05 — chosen so it doesn't collide with the
 * channel-push hourly availability reconciler that runs at :00.
 *
 * Per booking-journey-architecture §5.7 (hold release semantics
 * default to immediate; the per-supplier grace knob is a follow-up).
