## Commitment chain

For travel-native bespoke sales, the ladder is **Quote -> accepted Quote Version -> reserve workflow -> Booking / Component Booking -> Fulfillment**. Each step hardens the commitment, but accepting a Quote Version is not the same as supplier confirmation. Generic first-party **Order** is retired from v1 runtime language by ADR-0005; use Booking, Booking Origin, Finance/Legal target links, or provider/source order refs instead.

## Relationships (the domain laws)

- A **Person** may belong to zero or more **Organizations**; both can appear on Quotes, Programs, and Bookings.
- A **Quote** belongs to one Person and/or Organization, moves through a Pipeline, and produces zero or more **Quote Versions**.
- A **Quote Version** freezes a Trip Envelope snapshot; editing a sent Version creates another Version.
- Accepting a **Quote Version** marks that Version accepted, closes the Quote won, and seeds the reserve workflow; it does not mean every live or manual component is supplier-confirmed.
- A transactions **Legacy Offer** may still convert to a **Legacy Order** only in migration/compatibility flows; it is not the bespoke travel sales artifact called Quote.
- A **Booking Origin** records whether a Booking came from an accepted Quote Version, Trip snapshot, Catalog price/availability response, provider/source order ref, or legacy transaction id.
- A **Booking** is the first-party durable commitment record; do not require a generic first-party Order to create one.
- A **Booking** holds **Allocations** against **Slots** (or Pickups, or Resources); each Allocation belongs to exactly one Booking Item.
- Accommodation may be sold as **Sourced Inventory** or as a component of a **Product**, and may reference a **Place** for where the stay happens, but hotel/property operations are not a first-party implementation scenario.
- A **Booking Item** produces zero or more **Fulfillments**; each Fulfillment is delivered over exactly one channel.
- An **Invoice** targets a Booking, Program, Organization, Supplier/Channel relationship, Schedule line, or explicit legacy/provider reference. It does not require a generic first-party Order.
- A **Payment Schedule** belongs to a Booking; each schedule line resolves via a **Payment Session** to one or more **Payments**.
- A **Channel** sells via an **Allotment** (its reserved inventory) and earns via **Commission Rules**; **Settlement** runs reconcile its activity.
- A **Policy** is assigned by scope (Product, Channel, Market, Booking); a **Policy Acceptance** binds a specific Policy Version to a Person or Booking.
- **Cost** ≠ **Rate** ≠ **Price**: Cost is what we pay, Rate is the Supplier's per-unit tariff input, Price is what the customer sees.
- A **Product** is canonical module-owned truth; a **Catalog Item** is a derived sellable read model that may resolve to a Product or to Sourced Inventory.
- An **Operator Link** grants one or more capabilities (catalog, availability, booking, sync) between counterparties; an **Inventory Source** is one technical adapter behind that link.
- An Operator can be both an **Operating party** for some inventory and a **Reseller** for other inventory at the same time.
- A **Trip Envelope** groups Component Bookings and provider/source refs for customer experience and checkout; it does not erase the lifecycle boundaries of those components.
- Product-internal bundles and dependent **Extras** stay inside their Component Booking. Customer-composed additions with independent supplier/cancellation/tax/fulfillment state become sibling Component Bookings under the same Trip Envelope.
- A **Cruise Extension** is a vertical-specific category, not a generic synonym for Extra. Its catalog definition may be reused across cruises; apply the same lifecycle boundary rule to the selected extension to decide whether it is nested under the cruise booking or split into its own Component Booking.

## Example dialogue

> **Sales agent:** "I've got a hot **Quote** with the Henderson family — eight **Travelers**, two weeks in Egypt. I sent them a **Quote Version** last week."

> **Operations manager:** "Good. If they accept that Version, run reserve. Live lines must recheck **Sellability** and **Cost** from our Cairo **Suppliers**; manual lines move into supplier confirmation."

> **Sales agent:** "And the **Booking** is created immediately?"

> **Operations manager:** "Only after reserve can secure the component commitments. The **Booking** is operational: it holds **Allocations** against the **Slots** for each guided day, includes a **Stay Component** in Aswan, and sets up **Dispatches** with **Vehicles** and **Drivers** for the transfers."

> **Sales agent:** "What about the cancellation thing they asked about?"

> **Operations manager:** "That's the **Cancellation Policy** assigned to the Product. We'll record a **Policy Acceptance** against the specific **Policy Version** when they sign the **Contract**. If they later cancel, we **Cancel** the Booking — that's an operational reversal — and **Void** any Invoices that were never paid. If they paid, we issue a **Credit Note** instead."

> **Finance:** "Don't forget the **Payment Schedule**. Deposit at booking, balance 30 days out. The deposit is also our **Guarantee**. Each line goes through a **Payment Session** when collected."

> **Sales agent:** "What about the Viking sailings we're selling but not actually operating? They don't feel like our own **Products**."

> **Operations manager:** "Right — those are **Sourced Inventory**. Viking is the **Operating party**, we are the **Reseller**, and the feed comes through an **Inventory Source** behind an **Operator Link**."

> **Sales agent:** "So what shows up in search and in the storefront?"

> **Operations manager:** "A **Catalog Item**. For our own tours the Catalog Item resolves to a local **Product**. For Viking it resolves to sourced inventory. Same discovery surface, different source of truth."

## Flagged ambiguities

These terms are used loosely in conversation. Pick the canonical form below; treat the rest as smells when you see them in code or docs.

- **Customer / client / buyer** — none are first-class entities. The canonical CRM record is **Person** (with optional **Organization**). On a Booking, the buyer is captured as `personId` + `organizationId` snapshot fields. Avoid "customer" / "client" except in UI copy facing the operator's own staff.
- **Tour / experience** — usually collapse to **Product**. **Trip** and **package** are overloaded: use **Product** for an operator-sold offering, **Operated Group Departure** for a fixed-capacity product instance, and **Trip Envelope** for a customer-facing aggregate of multiple component commitments.
- **Place vs. legacy Facility** — use **Place** for shared physical places in new code and docs. `Facility` and `facilityId` remain compatibility names for current tables, routes, and public consumers.
- **Accommodation vs. hotel operations** — accommodation is valid as catalog inventory, sourced resale, trip composition, or as a Place reference. Hotel/property operations are not a first-party Voyant implementation scenario.
- **Quote vs. Opportunity** — the canonical sales pursuit is **Quote**. Opportunity is the old generic CRM name and should not appear in new public package surfaces.
- **Quote Version vs. Legacy Offer** — both look like "a price proposal". **Quote Version** is the travel-native proposal revision or alternative that freezes a Trip Envelope snapshot and can be accepted into reserve. **Legacy Offer** is the transactions-package primitive for pre-v1 compatibility flows. They are not synonyms.
- **Legacy Order / Provider Order Ref vs. Booking** — **Legacy Order** is a transactions compatibility primitive, and **Provider Order Ref** is an upstream identifier. **Booking** is the first-party durable commitment and operational record. Do not recreate a generic first-party Order when Booking origin/provenance or provider refs carry the needed meaning.
- **Reservation** — overloaded between "Hold" (a temporary inventory claim) and "Booking" (the persistent record). Use **Hold** or **Booking** — never "Reservation".
- **Cancel vs. Void vs. Close** — different verbs for different domains. **Cancel** = operational reversal (Booking, Allocation). **Void** = financial reversal (Invoice, Payment). **Close** = end a Quote with an outcome. Don't blend them.
- **Hold vs. Allocation vs. Reservation** — **Hold** is the temporal status of a Booking before confirmation (`hold_expires_at`). **Allocation** is the inventory-line entity (`held` → `confirmed` → `fulfilled`). Avoid "Reservation".
- **Supplier vs. Partner vs. Provider** — **Supplier** is the entity that sells us services. **Partner** is a relationship type on Organizations. **Provider** is for tech integrations (notification provider, storage provider) — do not call a hotel a "provider".
- **Channel vs. Distribution vs. Partner** — **Channel** is the outbound resale entity (the OTA, affiliate, marketplace, or API partner). **Distribution** is the broader commercial-network subdomain covering Channel and Supplier-side connectivity. Don't say "Partner" when you mean Channel, and don't use Distribution as the name of a counterparty record.
- **Supplier vs. Operator vs. Inventory Source** — **Supplier** is an operational vendor in local managed operations. **Operator** is the principal commercial/operational party in the network. **Inventory Source** is the technical integration path. TUI or Viking may be the upstream Operating party while Connect or a GDS is only the Inventory Source.
- **Product vs. Catalog Item** — **Product** is canonical local truth with admin ownership and operational modeling. **Catalog Item** is the normalized discovery projection that can represent either a local Product or Sourced Inventory. Do not import external inventory into Product just to make it searchable.
- **Reseller vs. Channel** — **Reseller** is a role an Operator can play relative to inventory. **Channel** is a distribution entity that sells our inventory. They overlap in commerce but are not the same record.
- **Contact** — too overloaded to use raw. Pick: **Person** (CRM record), **Contact Point** (email/phone/website on identity), **Named Contact** (titled role at an Organization), or **Participant** (role on a deal/order/booking).
- **Traveler vs. Participant vs. Guest** — **Traveler** is the person actually traveling (booking_travelers, with category and PII). **Participant** is the broader role-bearer on a transaction (booker, decision-maker, finance, traveler). Avoid "Guest"; use **Traveler** in bookings and rooming lists.
- **Capacity** is always a number, never a status. Slots have a capacity *and* a status — don't conflate them.
- **Cost / Rate / Price** — three distinct money concepts. **Cost** = our outflow to a Supplier. **Rate** = the Supplier's per-unit tariff (per_person, per_night, etc.). **Price** = what the customer pays. Never use them interchangeably even when numerically equal.
- **Issue vs. Fulfill vs. Deliver** — **Issue** = produce the artifact (Fulfillment, Invoice, Contract). **Fulfill** = mark operational completion of a Booking Item or Allocation. **Deliver** = transmit an issued artifact over a channel (email, download, wallet, API). Three steps, not synonyms.
